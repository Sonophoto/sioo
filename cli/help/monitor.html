<h2>NAME</h2>
monitor - Manage attachment of scripts to Soar events
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<b>monitor</b> <i>action</i>
<hr />
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>This command manages the attachment of scripts to Soar events. Soar
events are important events that occur in Soar as an agent is being
processed. Scripts can be attached to these Soar events so that they are
invoked every time the Soar event occurs. These scripts can also be removed
using the <b>monitor</b> command. The status of attachments can be listed
and tested. If a new attachment is created, its identifier is returned as
the result of this command. The identifier is used when deleting a script
from an event.</p>
<p>The specified <i>action</i> must have one of the following forms:</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>-add</b> <i>soar-event script [id]</i></dt>
<dd>Add the <i>script</i> to the list of scripts to be invoked when the
<i>soar-event</i> occurs in the Soar kernel. See below for a list of valid
Soar event names. If the <i>id</i> is given, it is used to name the
attachment. If no <i>id</i> is given, then a unique id is generated and
returned.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><b>-delete</b> <i>soar-event [id]</i></dt>
<dd>Remove scripts attached to <i>soar-event</i>. The <i>soar-event</i>
must match a valid Soar event name (see below). If <i>id</i> is given after
a <i>soar-event</i>, then only that particular attachment is removed.
Otherwise, all attachments under <i>soar-event</i> are removed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt class="c12">-list</dt>
<dd>List all attachments of scripts to Soar events</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt class="c12">-test</dt>
<dd>Test the script attachment process by attaching a print message to
every Soar event.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt class="c12">-clear</dt>
<dd>Remove <i>all</i> attached scripts.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
This command creates an attachment which prints a message after every Soar
decision cycle:
<pre>
<b>monitor -add after-decision-cycle {puts "Finished DC!"} </b>
</pre>
<p>This example creates an attachment which calls the Tcl procedure
"DoSomething" (presumably user-defined) after every production firing:</p>
<pre>
<b>monitor -add firing DoSomething</b>
</pre>
<p>This example creates an attachment which processes pending X events
after every decision cycle. This is needed in long-running Soar agents so
that GUIs do not appear frozen:</p>
<pre>
<b>monitor -add after-decision-cycle update</b>
</pre>
<p>This example adds an attachment which ticks a simulator after each agent
has completed a cycle in the Soar scheduler. Note that this example command
is executed in the global agent's interpreter so that the simulator is
ticked only once per schedule cycle. The "TickSimulator" command would be
defined by the user.</p>
<pre>
<b>monitor -add after-schedule-cycle TickSimulator</b>
</pre>
<p>This example adds an attachment that could be used to inform the Soar
development tool SDE that an agent has been selected for scheduling. SDE
expects certain strings in Soar output and uses them to control some SDE
operations.</p>
<pre>
<b>monitor -add before-schedule-cycle {puts "\nSelecting agent $soar_agent_name"}</b>
</pre>
<p>This example removes the single attachment "m1" which associates a
script with the Soar event after-init-agent:</p>
<pre>
<b>monitor -delete after-init-agent m1</b>
</pre>
<p>This example removes all script attachments to the Soar event
before-preference-phase-cycle:</p>
<pre>
<b>monitor -delete before-preference-phase-cycle</b>
</pre>
<p>This example removes all script attachments that have been added with
the monitor command:</p>
<pre>
<b>monitor -clear</b>
</pre>
<h2>SOAR EVENTS</h2>
This command utilizes the Soar callback system which can associate TCL or C
functions with Soar events. The permissable Soar event names are:
<dl>
<dt class="c12">system-termination</dt>
<dd>The Soar system is exiting.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt class="c12">after-init-agent</dt>
<dd>An agent has just been created and initialized.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt class="c12">before-init-soar</dt>
<dd>The agent is about to be initialized. The <b>init-soar</b> command will
generate this event.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt class="c12">after-init-soar</dt>
<dd>The agent has just been initialized. The <b>init-soar</b> command will
generate this event.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt class="c12">after-halt-soar</dt>
<dd>The agent has just been halted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt class="c12">before-schedule-cycle</dt>
<dd>This event is triggered by the <b>schedule</b> command. In the global
control agent, this event is triggered before each schedule cycle starts.
In other agents, this event is triggered during the schedule cycle, just
before the agent is run.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt class="c12">after-schedule-cycle</dt>
<dd>This event is triggered by the <b>schedule</b> command. In the global
control agent, this event is triggered just after each schedule cycle ends.
In other agents, this event is triggered during the schedule cycle, just
after the agent is run.</dd>
