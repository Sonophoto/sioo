<title>Commands: stop-soar</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>NAME</h2>
stop-soar - Stop Soar
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<b>stop-soar</b> [ <b>-self</b> [reason-string] ]
<hr />
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>Agents may be run using the <b>run</b> command. The <b>stop-soar</b>
command stops any running Soar agents. It sets a flag in the Soar kernel so
that Soar will stop running at a "safe" point and return control to the
user. This operates exactly as if the user had issued a control-C (SIGINT)
interrupt to the Soar process.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-self</dt>
<dd>Stop only the soar agent where the command is issued. All other agents
continue running as previously specified.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt class="c19">reason-string</dt>
<dd>An optional string following <b>-self</b> which will be printed when
Soar is stopped, to indicate why it was stopped. If left blank, no message
will be printed when Soar is stopped.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This command is usually not issued at the command line prompt. A more
common use of this command is as a side-effect of pressing a button on a
Graphical User Interface (GUI), or as a monitor to be executed at a
specific Soar Event. For example, a user may wish to examine an agent's
"matches" after the Soar Decision Phase. In order to do this in Soar 8, the
user must register a monitor, or callback, to issue the "stop-soar -self"
command for the event, after-decision-phase-cycle.</p>
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
<p>This example shows how to stop Soar8 after this decision phase using
<b>stop-soar -self</b> in a monitor to stop after the decision phase so
that memory can be examined.</p>
<pre>
 monitor -add {stop-soar -self "after decision phase"} \
        after-decision-phase-cycle

</pre>
<h2>WARNINGS</h2>
<b>If the graphical interface doesn't periodically do a Tcl "update"
command, then it may not be possible to interrupt a Soar agent from the
command line.</b>
