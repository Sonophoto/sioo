<h2>NAME</h2>
matches - List production match information
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<b>matches</b> <i>production-name</i> [<b>-count</b> | <b>-timetags</b> |
<b>-wmes</b> | <b>0</b> | <b>1</b> | <b>2</b>]<br />
<b>matches</b> [<b>-assertions</b> | <b>-retractions</b>] [<b>-names</b> |
<b>-timetags</b> | <b>-wmes</b> | <b>0</b> | <b>1</b> | <b>2</b>]
<hr />
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>This command prints partial match information for a selected production.
If issued at the end of the Decision Phase, it also prints the current set
of productions that are about to fire or retract in the next preference
phase. This information is useful for determining what changes to working
memory are necessary in order to achieve a match of the left-hand sides of
productions.</p>
<p>If no production name is given, then it is assumed that the user desires
information about the match set, including both assertions and
retractions.</p>
<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
Normally both assertions and retractions are printed by the <b>matches</b>
command. This can be restricted using one of the following options:
<dl>
<dt>-assertions</dt>
<dd>List only those productions about to fire</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-retractions</dt>
<dd>List only those productions about to retract</dd>
</dl>
<p>The optional detail specifies the kind of information desired and must
be one of the following (the <b>0</b> option is the default):</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>-count</b> or <b>-names</b> or <b>0</b></dt>
<dd>Print just the partial match counts. If the match set is being printed,
then print just the production names.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><b>-timetags</b> or <b>1</b></dt>
<dd>Print the same information as the <b>-count</b> option plus the
timetags of wmes at the the first failing condition</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><b>-wmes</b> or <b>2</b></dt>
<dd>Print the same information as the <b>-timetags</b> option except print
the full wmes rather than just their timetags</dd>
</dl>
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
This example prints the productions which are about to fire and the wmes
that match the productions on their left-hand sides:
<pre>
<b>matches -assertions -wmes</b>
</pre>
<p>This example prints the wme timetags for a single production. This
example takes advantage of the unique prefix abbreviation feature of
switches.</p>
<pre7>
matches -t my*first*production
</pre>
<h2>WARNINGS</h2>
<p>In Soar 8, the Decision Phase occurs in the middle of the
Decision Cycle, followed by the Apply Phase. Therefore, at the end of the
Decision Cycle, productions will have already fired and the "matches"
command will not be very helpful. To examine the match information in
immediately after the Decision Phase in Soar 8, users can implement either
of the following callbacks:</p>
<pre>
<b>monitor -add {matches -wmes} after-decision-phase-cycle</b>
</pre>
<pre>
monitor -add {stop-soar -self} after-decision-phase-cycle
</pre>
<p><b>The first example can use any options to the matches</b> command,
whatever the user finds most helpful. The second option, which stops Soar
at the end of the Decision Phase, offers the most flexibility for
debugging. It is recommended that users issue this callback for all agents,
so they don't get out of synch when running. Once the productions have been
debugged, the monitors can be deleted.</p>
