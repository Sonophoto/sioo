<h2>NAME</h2>
rete-net - Save and restore the Rete net
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<b>rete-net</b> <i>{-save | -load} filename</i>
<hr />
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>The <b>rete-net</b> command saves and restores the state of the Rete
network. This command provides a fast method of saving and loading
productions since a binary format is used. rete-net files are portable
across platforms that support Soar. The action must be one of the
following:</p>
<dl>
<dt class="c15">-save</dt>
<dd>Save the Rete network in the given <i>filename</i>. The Rete network
cannot be saved while there are justifications present. These can be
eliminated by using the <b>init-soar</b> command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt class="c15">-load</dt>
<dd>Load the productions stored in <i>filename</i> into the Rete network.
In order to load productions stored in binary form, working memory and
production memory must both be empty. Working memory can be emptied by
using the <b>init-soar</b> command. Production memory can be emptied by
using the <b>excise -all</b> command.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the <i>filename</i> contains a suffix of ".Z", then the file is
compressed automatically when it is saved and uncompressed when it is
loaded.</p>
<h2>WARNINGS</h2>
Compressed files may not be portable to another platform is that platform
does not support the same uncompress utility.
