<h2>NAME</h2>
watch - Run-time tracing of Soar
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<b>watch</b> [<i>level</i>*] [-on | -off | -inc[lusive]]<br />
<b>watch wmes</b> [-on | -off | -inc[lusive] | filter-options]<br />
<b>watch</b> [ aliases | backtracing | loading ] [-on | -off ]<br />
<b>watch</b> [ learning ] [-noprint | -print | -fullprint ]
<hr />
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>The <b>watch</b> command controls run-time tracing of Soar. With no
arguments, this command prints out the current watch status. The various
<i>level</i>s are used to modify the current watch settings. Each
<i>level</i> can be indicated with either a number or a named flag as
follows:</p>
<pre>
0  none
1  decisions
2  phases
3  productions
4  wmes
5  preferences
</pre>
<p>The numerical arguments (0 - 5) do not take any arguments or modifiers.
They inclusively turn on all levels up to the number specified. To use
numerical arguments to turn off a level, specify a number which is less
than the level to be turned off. For instance, to turn off watching of
productions, specify "watch 2" (or 1 or 0). Numerical arguments are
provided for shorthand convenience. For more detailed control over the
watch settings, the named arguments should be used.</p>
<p>For the named arguments, setting either the -<b>on</b> or -<b>off</b>
switch selectively turns on or off only that setting. Setting the
-<b>inclusive</b> switch (which can be abbreviated as -inc) or setting no
flag at all has the effect of setting all levels up to and including the
level specified. For example, <b>watch productions -on</b> selectively
turns on the tracing of production firings/retractions; <b>watch
productions -off</b> selectively turns it off again. <b>watch productions
[-inc]</b> turns on the tracing of productions and also turns on tracing of
all levels below productions: decisions and phases, too. Individual watch
parameters may be used to modify the inclusive settings as well,
selectively turning on or off any levels outside or inside the inclusive
range.</p>
<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
<p>The following options are allowed (<i>status</i> is given as either
-<b>on</b>, -<b>off</b>, or -<b>inclusive</b>, -<b>inc</b> is the
default):</p>
<dl>
<dt>0 | <b>none</b></dt>
<dd>turns off all printing about Soar's internals</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>1 | <b>decisions</b> <i>status</i></dt>
<dd>controls whether state and operator decisions are printed as they are
made</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>2 | <b>phases</b> <i>status</i></dt>
<dd>controls whether decisions cycle phase names are printed as Soar
executes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>3 | <b>productions</b> <i>status</i></dt>
<dd>controls whether the names of productions are printed as they fire and
retract. See the optional arguments below
[-all|-chunks|-defaults|-justifications|-user] which specify which types of
productions the <i>status</i> argument refers to.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>4 | <b>wmes</b></dt>
<dd>controls the printing of working memory elements that are added and
deleted as productions are fired and retracted.</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
To improve state tracing, the following filter-options
are available to <b>watch wmes</b> for monitoring a specified
object-attribute-value triplet:
</pre>
<pre>

{-add-filter    <i>type filter</i>} |
{-remove-filter <i>type filter</i>} |
{-reset-filter  <i>type</i>       } |
{-list-filter   <i>type</i>       } 
</pre>
<pre>

<br />where:
</pre>
<pre>

<i>type</i>   = -adds | -removes | -both
<i>filter</i> = {<i>id</i>|*} {<i>attribute</i>|*} {<i>value</i>|*}
</pre>
<pre>

</pre>
<dl>
<dt>5 | <b>preferences</b> <i>status</i></dt>
<dd>controls whether the preferences generated by the traced productions
are printed when those productions fire or retract. When a production
fires, all the preferences it generates are printed. When it retracts, only
the ones being removed from preference memory are printed (i.e., the
i-supported ones).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt class="c22">-nowmes | -timetags | -fullwmes</dt>
<dd>controls the level of detail given about the wmes matched by
productions whose firings and retractions are being traced. Level 0|-nowmes
means no information about the wmes is printed. Level 1|-timetags means the
wme timetags are printed. Level 2|-fullwmes means the whole wmes are
printed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><b>-all|-default|-user|-chunks|-justifications</b>
<i>[modifier]</i></dt>
<dd>allows user to selectively control printing by production *type* as
they fire and retract, instead of having to watch ALL productions or none.
(NOTE: these args can be abbreviated by the first char ONLY, otherwise the
full arg must be specified.) The modifier can be one of:</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
<b>-noprint|-print|-fullprint</b>
</pre>
<pre>
-noprint prints nothing, 
-print prints the production name,
-fullprint prints the entire production. (not done as of 8.2)
</pre>
<p>The following options control printing of other Soar parameters and are
not part of the above set of levels which can be controlled as a group.</p>
<dl>
<dt>aliases -on | -off</dt>
<dd>controls the echoing of aliases as they are defined.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>backtracing -on | -off</dt>
<dd>controls the printing of backtracing information when a chunk or
justification is created.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>loading -on | -off</dt>
<dd>controls the printing of '*' for each production loaded and a '#' for
each production excised</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt class="c22">learning -noprint | -print | -fullprint</dt>
<dd>controls the printing of chunks/justifications as they are created.
-noprint is don't print anything, -print prints just the names, -fullprint
prints the entire chunk/justification.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
The most common uses of <b>watch</b> are by using the numeric arguments
which indicate <b>watch</b> levels:
<pre>
<b>watch 0</b>
</pre>
which turns off all printing of Soar internals (same as watch none), or
<pre>
<b>watch 3</b>
</pre>
which turns on printing of decisions, phases and productions (same as watch
productions). Of course, individual options can be changed as well:
<pre class="c23">
watch 1 wmes -on 
</pre>
<b>turns on printing of decisions and wmes, but not phases and productions.
While</b>
<pre>
watch 4 phases -off
</pre>
<b>turns on printing of decisions, productions and wmes, and turns phases
off.</b>
<p class="c24">To watch the firing and retraction of only USER
productions:</p>
<pre>
<b>watch productions -user -print</b>
</pre>
<p>whereas this command would watch decisions, phases and ALL
productions:</p>
<pre>
<b>watch productions</b>
</pre>
<h2>NOTE</h2>
The pwatch command is used to watch named productions.
