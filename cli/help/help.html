<title>Commands: help</title>

<body>
<h2>NAME</h2>
help - Print man pages for Soar commands
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<b>help</b> [<b>-all</b> | <i>commandname</i> [<b>-usage</b>]]
<hr />
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>This command prints the formatted manual page for the given
<i>commandname</i>. Soar's help facility is able to do command completion,
so as long as a unique substring of the commandname is specified, Soar will
find and display the help page.</p>
<p>Under the TSI (Tcl-Soar Interface, a graphical interface to Soar), the
<b>help</b> will pop up a separate window to display the text.</p>
<p>Under Unix with no TSI running, the <b>help</b> command attempts to
locate a pager program to use to display help pages page-by-page since some
are longer than a typical screen. The command first examines the
environment variable PAGER to see if the user has defined a preference
there. If that is not present, the help system checks to see if one of the
commonly used pagers "less", "more", or "page" is available (in that
order). If no pager is available, then an error message is given. If no
pagers exist on your system, then you can set the environment variable
PAGER to "cat" and the help pages will simply be cat'ed to the screen.
Since some pages are long, this will make it difficult to read an entire
page.</p>
<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
<dl>
<dt>-all</dt>
<dd>List all commands for which help is available</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-usage</dt>
<dd>List only the SYNOPSIS section of the man page. This includes the
abbreviated syntax for the command. -usage may not work properly on some
windows and mac systems.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>FILES</h2>
<p>The nroff sources for the manual pages are stored in the subdirectory
.../doc/man. These files are used to generate the "cat" and "HTML" versions
which are stored in .../doc/cat and .../doc/html, respectively.</p>
<h2>ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<dl>
<dt>PAGER</dt>
<dd>This variable contains the user's preferred paging program which shows
text page by page rather than spewing all text at once to standard output.
Typical pagers are <b>more</b>, <b>less</b>, and <b>page</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>WARNINGS</h2>
Some pages, such as <b>less</b> clear the screen upon exit, removing the
help page from view. If you wish to retain the help page, use a pager such
as <b>more</b>.
