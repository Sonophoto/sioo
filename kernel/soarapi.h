 * 
 *         This is the command for running Soar agents.  It takes two
 *         optional arguments, one specifying how many things to run,
 *         and one specifying what type of things to run (by default
 *         all agents are run).  The following types are available:
 *          - \b p  - run Soar for n phases.  A phase is either an input 
 *                    phase, preference phase, working memory phase, output 
 *                    phase, or decision phase.
 *          - \b e  - run Soar for n elaboration cycles.  (For purposes of 
 *                    this command, decision phase is counted as an 
 *                    elaboration cycle.)
 *          - \b d  - run Soar for n decision cycles.
 *          - \b s  - run Soar until the nth time a state is selected.
 *          - \b o  - run Soar until the nth time an operator is selected.
 *          - \b out - run Soar by decision cycles until output is generated.
 *          - \e context-variable - run Soar until the nth time a selection 
 *                     is made for that particular context slot, or until the 
 *                     context stack pops to above that context.
 *         Unlike Soar 6 "go" , "run" has no memory of settings from
 *         previous run commands.

 *   \arg run e       -> run all agents for 1 elaboration cycle
 *   \arg run 1 s     -> run all agents until the next state is selected 
 *                            (i.e., until the next time an impasse arises)
 *   \arg run <so>    -> run until the next superoperator is selected

 * \brief This is the command procedure for the "explain-backtraces"

 *
 *        Explain provides some interpretation of backtraces generated
 *        during chunking.  Explain mode must be ON when the chunk/ 
 *        justification is CREATED or no explanation will be
 *        available.  Explain mode is toggled using the
 *        save_backtraces variable.  When explain mode is on, more
 *        memory is used, and building chunks/justifications will be
 *        slower.
 *
 *        The two most useful commands are 'explain-backtraces <name>'
 *        and *'explain-backtraces <name> <cond-num>'.  The first
 *        command lists all of the conditions for the named

 *        inclusion in the chunk/justification.  A 'ground' is a WME 
 *        which was tested in the supergoal.  Just knowing which WME
 *        was tested may be enough to explain why the
 *        chunk/justification exists.  If not, the conditions can be
 *        listed with an integer value.  This value can be used in
 *        'explain <name> <cond-num>' to obtain a list of the
 *        productions which fired to obtain this condition in the
 *        chunk/justification (and the crucial WMEs tested along the

 * soar_FormatWatch --
 *
 * \brief  This is the command procedure for the "format-watch" 
 *         command, which defines the format to use when printing 
 *         objects and the Soar goal stack.
 *
 *         Object trace formats control how Soar prints an object--
 *         e.g., a certain operator, problem-space, etc.  (This is 
 *         like trace-attributes in Soar 5.)  Stack trace formats 
 *         control how Soar prints its context stack selections in
 *         'watch 0' and 'pgs' printouts.  You specify a trace 
 *         format by indicating two things: 
 *           - a format string, indicating the printout format to be used
 *           - what things this format string can be applied to
 *         The format string can be any string.  Certain 'escape
 *         sequences' can be used within the string; for example,
 *         '%dc' means print the current decision cycle number.
 * 
 *        There are two ways to restrict what objects a format string
 *        applies to.  The {s|o|*} argument restricts the types of
 *        objects: 's' indicates that the format only applies to 
 *        states; 'o' means it only applies to operators; and '*'
 *        means it applies to any type of object.  The [object-name] 
 *        argument (for object trace formats), if given, means it only
 *        applies to objects with that ^name.  The [ps-name]
 *        argument (for stack trace formats) means it only applies
 *        within problem spaces with that ^name.
 * 
 *        With an -add argument, these commands add new trace formats
 *        (replacing any existing ones with identical applicability
 *        conditions).  With a -remove argument, they remove trace 
 *        formats with the given applicability conditions.  With no 
 *        arguments, they print out all current trace formats.
 *
 *        The following escape sequences can be used within trace
 *        format strings.  The S indicates the sequence is ONLY usable
 *        in stack traces:
 *
 *  \arg %cs                S- print the current state
 *  \arg %co                S- print the current operator 
 *                          * The %cg, %cp, %cs, and %co sequences use 
 *                            the appropriate object trace format.
 *  \arg %dc                S- print the current decision cycle number 
 *  \arg %ec                S- print the current elaboration cycle number
 *                          * The %dc and %ec sequences are NOT
 *                          * meaningful in stack traces produced by 
 *                            the "pgs" command.  In these cases, nothing 
 *                            is printed.

/**
 *
 *
 * soar_Watch --
 *
 * \brief  This is the command procedure for the "watch" command, which 
 *         controls run-time tracing.
 *
 *         This command controls what information gets printed in the
 *         run-time trace.  With no arguments, it just prints out the
 *         current watch status.  The numeric arguments are different
 *         from the semantics in Soar 5 and 6; for details, see help
 *         watch.  Setting either the -on or -off switch selectively
 *         turns on or off only that setting.  Setting the
 *         -inclusive switch (which can be abbreviated as -inc) or
 *         setting no flag at all has the effect of setting all
 *         levels up to and including the level specified.  For
 *         example, watch productions -on selectively turns on the
 *         tracing of production firings/retractions; watch
 *         productions -off selectively turns it off again.  watch
 *         productions [-inc] turns on the tracing of productions
 *         and also turns on tracing of all levels below
 *         productions: decisions and phases, too.  Individual
 *         watch parameters may be used to modify the inclusive
 *         settings as well, selectively turning on or off and levels
 *         outside or inside the inclusive range.
 *
 *         The following keyword arguments may be given to the 'watch'
 *         command:
 *
 * \arg \c 0|none   -- turns off all printing about Soar's internals
 * \arg \c 1|decisions -- controls whether state and operator decisions
 *                are printed as they are made
 * \arg \c 2|phases -- controls whether phase names are printed as Soar 
 *                executes
 * \arg \c 3|productions -- controls whether the names of productions are
 *               printed as they fire and retract.  See individual 
 *               production-type args below.
 * \arg \c 4|wmes --  controls whether changes to working memory are printed
 * \arg \c 5|preferences -- controls whether the preferences generated by the
 *               traced  productions  are printed when those productions
 *               fire or retract.  When  a  production  fires,  all  the
 *               preferences it generates are printed. When it retracts,
 *               only the ones being removed from preference memory  are
 *               printed (i.e., the i-supported ones).
 *
 * \arg \c -nowmes|-timetags|-fullwmes --  controls the level of detail given
 *               about the wmes matched by productions whose firings and 
 *               retractions are being traced.  Level 0|-nowmes means no 
 *               information about the wmes is printed.  Level 1|-timetags 
 *               means the wme timetags are printed.  Level 2|-fullwmes
 *               means the whole wmes are printed.
 *
 * \arg \c -all|-default|-chunks|-justifications|-user {-noprint|-print|-fullprint}
 *               allows user to selectively print production *types*
 *               as they fire and retract.  -noprint prints nothing,
 *               -print prints the production name, -fullprint prints the
 *               entire production.  (fullprint not yet implemented)
 *               NOTE:  these args can be abbreviated by the first
 *               char ONLY, otherwise the full arg must be specified.
 * \arg \c -prefs|-noprefs -- turns on|off the printing of preferences for
 *               the productions being watched.  These args need to be
 *               made to apply to just the given production type, instead
 *               of to all productions.
 *
 * \arg \c aliases -on|-off -- controls the echoing of aliases as they are
 *               defined.
 * \arg \c backtracing -on|-off -- controls the printing of backtracing
 *               information when a chunk or justification os created.
 * \arg \c learning -noprint|-print|-fullprint -- controls the printing of
 *               chunks/justifications as they are created. -noprint is
 *               don't print anything, -names prints just the names,
 *               -fullprint prints the entire chunk/justification.
 * \arg \c loading -on|-off  -- controls the printing of '*' for each
 *               production loaded and a '#' for each production excised.
 *
 *      Currently the following args apply to all productions being
 *      watched, but they need to be changed to apply to only the
 *      specified production type.  This requires the addition of many
 *      new kernel flags, one for each arg for each production type.
