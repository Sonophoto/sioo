                    Transitive Closure Numbers

   In many places, we do transitive closures or some similar process in
   which we mark identifiers and/or variables so as not to repeat them
   later.  Marking is done by setting the "tc_num" field of the symbol
   to the "current transitive closure number".  We don't have to go
   back and unmark stuff when done--we just increment the current
   transitive closure number next time.  Whenever we need to start a
   new marking, we call get_new_tc_number() (see production.c comments
   below).

                                 mem.c

   Init_memory_utilities() should be called before any of these routines
   are used.

   Basic memory allocation utilities:

     All memory blocks are allocated via calls to allocate_memory().  It
     calls malloc() and aborts if we run out of memory.  Free_memory() is
     the inverse of allocate_memory().  Allocate_memory_and_zerofill()
     does the obvious thing.  These routines take a usage_code indicating
     what purpose the memory is for (hash tables, strings, etc.).  This
     is used purely for statistics keeping.

     the API function, soar_ecPrintMemoryStatistics(), prints out
     stats on the memory usage.

   String utilities:

     Make_memory_block_for_string() takes a pointer to a string, allocates
     a memory block just large enough to hold the string, and copies the
     string into the block.   Free_memory_block_for_string() frees the
     block.
     
     "Growable strings" provide a convenient way of building up a string
     piece by piece without having to pre-allocate the right amount of
     memory.  To initialize one, say "gs = make_blank_growable_string()"
     where "gs" is of type "growable_string".  To concatenate a new string
     onto the end of an existing growable string, call
     add_to_growable_string(&gs,new_string) [note the "&"].  When you're
     done using it, call free_growable_string(gs).  Growable strings are
     implemented by allocating a block of memory large enough to hold
     (1) the memory block's size, (2) the current string length, and (3)
     the current text of the string.  Add_to_growable_string() may result
     in a new (larger) memory block being allocated and the text of the 
     string being copied.  Three macros provide access to a growable string's
     parts:  memsize_of_growable_string(), length_of_growable_string(),
     and (most importantly) text_of_growable_string(), which is of type
     (char *).
     
   Memory pools:

     To allocate and free memory items efficiently at run time, we use
     pools of small fixed-size items and do allocation and freeing using
     inline macros.  Different memory pools are used for different things
     and contain different size items.  Each pool consists of a memory_pool
     structure (used for maintaining the pool) and a chain of big blocks
     of memory (currently about 32K per block) obtained from allocate_memory().
     We maintain a free_list of small items not being used, and allocate by
     grabbing the first item on the free list.  If the free list is empty,
     we add another big block to the pool.

     Init_memory_pool() should be called to initialize a memory_pool
     structure before it is used.  After that, the macro forms
     allocate_with_pool (&mem_pool, &pointer_to_be_set_to_new_item)
     and free_with_pool (&mem_pool, pointer_to_item) are used to
     allocate and free items.  The API Function,
     soar_ecPrintMemoryPoolStatistics(), prints stats about the
     various pools in use and how much memory each is using.

   Cons cell and list utilities:

     This provides a simple facility for manipulating generic lists, just
     like in Lisp.  A "cons" is a pair of pointers; a "list" is just a cons
     (or NIL).  We maintain a memory pool (see above) of conses.
     Allocate_cons() is like allocate_with_pool() for conses; free_cons()
     is like free_with_pool.  Push(new_item,my_list) is a macro for adding
     a new item onto the front of an existing list.

     In addition to the regular conses, we also have a pool of "dl_cons"es--
     these are like conses, only doubly-linked.  A "dl_list" is a just a
     dl_cons (or NIL).

     Some (consed) list utility functions:  destructively_reverse_list()
     does just what it says, and returns a pointer to the new head of the
     list (formerly the tail).  Member_of_list() tests membership, using
     "==" as the equality predicates.  Add_if_not_member() is like Lisp's
     "pushnew"; it returns the new list (possibly unchanged) list.
     Free_list() frees all the cons cells in the list.

     Sometimes we need to surgically extract particular elements from a
     list.  Extract_list_elements() and extract_dl_list_elements() do this.
     They use a callback function that indicates which elements to extract:
     the callback function is called on each element of the list, and should
     return TRUE for the elements to be extracted.  The two extraction
     functions return a list (or dl_list) of the extracted elements.

   Hash table routines:

     We use hash tables in various places, and don't want to have to fix
     their size ahead of time.  These routines provide hash tables that
     are dynamically resized as items are added and removed.  We use
     "open hashing" with a hash table whose size is a power of two.  We
     keep track of how many items are in the table.  The table grows
     when # of items >= 2*size, and shrinks when # of items < size/2.
     To resize a hash table, we rehash every item in it.

     Each item must be a structure whose first field is reserved for use
     by these hash table routines--it points to the next item in the hash
     bucket.  Hash tables are created and initialized via make_hash_table();
     you give it a hash function (i.e., a C function) that finds the hash
     value for a given item, hashing it to a value num_bits wide.  For aid
     in this, we provide masks_for_n_low_order_bits[] that select out the
     low-order bits of a value:  (x & masks_for_n_low_order_bits[23]) picks
     out the 23 low-order bits of x.
     
     Items are added/removed from a hash table via add_to_hash_table() and
     remove_from_hash_table().  These calls resize the hash table if
     necessary.
     
     The contents of a hash table (or one bucket in the table) can be
     retrieved via do_for_all_items_in_hash_table() and
     do_for_all_items_in_hash_bucket().  Each uses a callback function,
     invoking it with each successive item.  The callback function should
     normally return FALSE.  If the callback function ever returns TRUE,
     iteration over the hash table items stops and the do_for_xxx()
     routine returns immediately.

                             lexer.c

  The lexer reads files and returns a stream of lexemes.  Get_lexeme() is
  the main routine; it looks for the next lexeme in the input, and stores
  it in the global variable "lexeme".  See the structure definition below.

  Restrictions:  the lexer cannot read individual input lines longer than
  MAX_LEXER_LINE_LENGTH characters.  Thus, a single lexeme can't be longer
  than that either.

  The lexer maintains a stack of files being read, in order to handle nested
  loads.  Start_lex_from_file() and stop_lex_from_file() push and pop the
  stack.  Immediately after start_lex_from_file(), the current lexeme (global
  variable) is undefined.  Immediately after stop_lex_from_file(), the 
  current lexeme is automatically restored to whatever it was just before
  the corresponding start_lex_from_file() call.
  
  Determine_possible_symbol_types_for_string() is a utility routine which
  figures out what kind(s) of symbol a given string could represent.
  
  Print_location_of_most_recent_lexeme() is used to print an indication
  of where a parser error occurred.  It tries to print out the current
  source line with a pointer to where the error was detected.
  
  Current_lexer_parentheses_level() returns the current level of parentheses
  nesting (0 means no open paren's have been encountered).
  Skip_ahead_to_balanced_parentheses() eats lexemes until the appropriate
  closing paren is found (0 means eat until back at the top level).
  
  Fake_rparen_at_next_end_of_line() tells the lexer to insert a fake
  R_PAREN_LEXEME token the next time it reaches the end of a line.
  
  Set_lexer_allow_ids() tells the lexer whether to allow identifiers to
  be read.  If FALSE, things that look like identifiers will be returned
  as SYM_CONSTANT_LEXEME's instead.

                             symtab.c

   Soar 6 uses five kinds of symbols:  symbolic constants, integer
   constants, floating-point constants, identifiers, and variables.
   We use five resizable hash tables, one for each kind of symbol.

   "symbol" is typedef-ed as a union of the five kinds of symbol
   structures.  Some fields common to all symbols are accessed via
   sym->common.field_name; fields particular to a certain kind of
   symbol are accessed via sym->var.field_name_on_variables, etc.
   (See the definitions below.)  Note that "common" is #defined below.

   Some (but not all) of the fields common to all symbols are:
      symbol_type:  indicates which of the five kinds of symbols this is
      reference_count:  current reference count for this symbol
      hash_id:  used for hash functions in the rete (and elsewhere)
      
   Fields on symbolic constants:
      name:  points to null-terminated string giving its name
      production:  points to a production structure, or NIL if there is
                   no production with that name

   Fields on integer constants:
      value:  gives the value of the symbol.  This is of type (long).

   Fields on floating-point constants:
      value:  gives the value of the symbol.  This is of type (float).

   Fields on variables:
      name:  points to null-terminated string giving its name
      tc_num:  used for transitive closure computations
      current_binding_value:  when productions are fired, this indicates
                              the variable's binding
      gensym_number:  used by the variable generator to prevent certain
                      already-in-use variables from being generated
      rete_binding_locations:  used temporarily by the Rete, while adding
                      productions, to store a list of places where this
                      variable is bound and/or tested

   Fields on identifiers:

       name_number, name_letter:  indicate the name of the identifier

       isa_goal, isa_impasse:  indicate whether this is the identifier of a
                               goal or attribute impasse

       isa_operator:  keeps a count of how many (normal or acceptable
                      preference) wmes contain (^operator <this-id>).
                      The tracing code uses this to figure out whether
                      a given object is an operator.

       allow_bottom_up_chunks:  Used for bottom-up chunking, and only on goal
         identifiers.  This is TRUE iff no chunk has yet been built for a
         subgoal of this goal.
        
       could_be_a_link_from_below:  TRUE if there might be a link to this id
         from some other id lower in the goal stack.

       did_PE: 

       level:  current goal_stack_level of this id

       promotion_level:  level to which this id is going to be promoted as
         soon as ownership info is updated.

       link_count:  count of how many links there are to this id.

       unknown_level:  if the goal_stack_level of this id is known, this is
         NIL.  If the level isn't known, it points to a dl_cons in a dl_list
         used by the demotion routines.

       slots:  this is the header for a dll of the slots for this id.

       tc_num:  used for transitive closures, marking id's, etc.
 
       variablization:  used by the chunker when variablizing chunks--this
         points to the variable to which this id gets changed

       impasse_wmes:  for goal and impasse ids only:  this is the header
         of the dll of architecture-created wmes (e.g., (G37 ^object G36))

       higher_goal, lower_goal:  for goals, these point to adjacent goals
         in the context stack
       problem_space_slot, state_slot, operator_slot:  for goals, these
         point to the corresponding context slots
       preferences_from_goal:  for goals, this is the header of the dll
         of all preferences supported by this goal.  This is needed so
         we can remove o-supported preferences when the goal goes away.

       gds: pointer to a goal's dependency set
       saved_firing_type: the firing type that must be restored if
          Waterfall processing returns to this level. see consistency.c
       ms_o_assertions:  dll of o-assertions at this level
       ms_i_assertions:  dll of i-assertions at this level
       ms_retractions:   dll of all retractions at this level

       associated_output_links:  used by the output module

       input_wmes:  dll of wmes added by input functions

   Reference counting for symbols:  I can't remember all the places I add
     reference counts to symbols.  Here's a bunch I can remember though.
     If you're not sure whether to add/remove a reference for something,
     it's better to play it safe and do the add/remove.

     +1 for each occurrence in a rete test or alpha mem constant test
     +1 for each occurrence in a condition test anywhere
     +1 for each occurrence in a Not
     +1 for each occurrence in a saved_test
     +1 for each occurrence in a WME
     +1 for each occurrence in a preference
     +1 for each occurrence as {id or attr} of a slot
     +1 for goal/impasse identifiers
     +1 if it's the name of a production
     +1 if it's a predefined symbol (e.g., "goal" or "operator")
     +1 for each enqueued add-link or remove-link to/from it
     +1 for each occurrence in a global var. (e.g., chunk-free-problem-spaces)

  We deallocate a symbol when its reference count goes to 0.

                       Symbol Table Routines

   Initialization:

     Init_symbol_tables() should be called first, to initialize the
     module.

   Lookup and Creation:

     The find_xxx() routines look for an existing symbol and return it
     if found; if no such symbol exists, they return NIL.

     The make_xxx() routines look for an existing symbol; if the find one,
     they increment the reference count and return it.  If no such symbol
     exists, they create a new one, set the reference count to 1, and
     return it.

     Note that rather than a make_identifier() routine, we have a
     make_new_identifier() routine, which takes two arguments: the first
     letter for the new identifier, and its initial goal_stack_level.
     There is no way to force creation of an identifier with a particular
     name letter/number combination like J37.

   Reference Counting:

     Symbol_add_ref() and symbol_remove_ref() are macros for incrementing
     and decrementing the reference count on a symbol.  When the count
     goes to zero, symbol_remove_ref() calls deallocate_symbol().

   Other Utilities:

     Reset_id_counters() is called during an init-soar to reset the id
     gensym numbers to 1.  It first makes sure there are no existing
     identifiers in the system--otherwise we might generate a second
     identifier with the same name later on.

     Reset_id_and_variable_tc_numbers() resets the tc_num field of every
     existing id and variable to 0.
     
     Reset_variable_gensym_numbers() resets the gensym_number field of
     every existing variable to 0.
     
     Print_internal_symbols() just prints a list of all existing symbols.
     (This is useful for debugging memory leaks.)
     
     Generate_new_sym_constant() is used to gensym new symbols that are
     guaranteed to not already exist.  It takes two arguments: "prefix"
     (the desired prefix of the new symbol's name), and "counter" (a
     pointer to a counter (unsigned long) that is incremented to produce
     new gensym names).

                      Working Memory Elements (WMEs)

   Fields in a WME:

      id, attr, value:  points to symbols for the wme fields

      acceptable:  TRUE iff this is an acceptable pref. wme

      timetag:  timetag of the wme

      reference count:  (see below)

      rete_next, rete_prev:  pointers in the doubly-linked list of all
         wmes currently known to the rete (header is all_wmes_in_rete)
         (this equals WM except while WM is being changed)

      right_mems:  header of a doubly-linked list of right memory entries
         (in one or more alpha memories containing the wme).  This is used
         only by the Rete, as part of list-based remove.

      tokens:  header of a doubly-linked list of tokens in the Rete.
         This is used only by the Rete, as part of list-based remove.

      next, prev:  pointers in a doubly-linked list of wmes.
         Depending on the wme type, the header of this DLL is:
           - slot.wmes (for ordinary wmes)
           - slot.acceptable_preference_wmes (for acceptable pref. wmes)
           - id.impasse_wmes (for architecture-created goal/impasse wmes)
           - id.input_wmes (for Soar I/O wmes)

      preference:  points to the preference supporting the wme.  For I/O
         wmes and (most) architecture-created wmes, this is NIL.

      output_link:  this is used only for top-state output links.
         It points to an output_link structure used by the I/O routines.

      grounds_tc, potentials_tc, locals_tc:  used by the chunker to indicate
         whether this wme is in the grounds, potentials, and/or locals sets

      chunker_bt_pref: used by the chunker; set to cond->bt.trace when
         a wme is added to either the potentials or locals set

      These are the additions to the WME structure that will be used
         to track dependencies for goals.  Each working memory element
	 now includes a pointer  to a gds_struct (defined below) and
	 pointers to other WMEs on the same GDS.

      gds: the goal dependency set the wme is in
      gds_next, gds_prev:  used for dll of all wmes in gds

      If a particular working memory element is not dependent for any goal,
	 then the values for these pointers will all be NIL. If a WME is
	 dependent for more than one goal, then it will point to the GDS
	 of the highest goal.
	

      

   Reference counts on wmes:
      +1 if the wme is currently in WM
      +1 for each instantiation condition that points to it (bt.wme)
   We deallocate a wme when its reference count goes to 0.

			     Goal Dependency Set

   The Goal Dependency Set is a data strcuture used in Operand2 to maintain
   the integrity of a subgoal with respect to changes in supergoal WMEs.
   Whenever a WME in the goal's dependency set changes, the goal is immediately
   removed.  The routines for maintaining the GDS and determining if a goal
   should be retracted are in decide.c

   Fields in a goal dependency set:

      goal:  points to the goal for which this dependency set was created.
             The goal also has a pointer back to the GDS.

      wmes_in_gds:  A DLL of WMEs in the goal dependency set

   The GDS is created only when necessary; that is, when an o-suppported WME
   is created in some subgoal and that subgoal has no GDS already.  The
   instantiations that led to the creation of the o-supported WME are 
   examined; any supergoal WMEs in these instantiations are added to the 
   wmes_in_gds DLL.  The GDS for each goal is examined for every WM change;
   if a WME changes that is on a GDS, the goal that the GDS points to is
   immediately removed.  

   When a goal is removed, the GDS is not immediately removed.  Instead,
   whenever a WME is removed (or when it is added to another GDS), we check
   to also make certain that its GDS has other WMEs on the wmes_in_gds DLL.
   If not, then we remove the GDS then.  This delay avoids having to scan
   over all the WMEs in the GDS in addition to removing the goal (i.e., the
   maintenance cost is amortized over a number of WM phases).

                               Preferences

   Fields in a preference:

      type:  indicates the type of the preference.  This is one of the
             types defined below:  ACCEPTABLE_PREFERENCE_TYPE, etc.

      o_supported:  TRUE iff the preference has o-support

      in_tm:  TRUE iff the preference is currently in temporary memory

      on_goal_list:  TRUE iff the preference is on the list of preferences
                     supported by its match goal (see all_of_goal_next below)

      reference_count:  (see below)

      id, attr, value, referent:  points to the symbols.  Referent is only
                                  used for binary preferences.

      slot:  points to the slot this preference is for.  (NIL if the
        preference is not in TM.)

      next, prev:  used for a doubly-linked list of preferences of the
                   same type in that particular slot

      all_of_slot_next, all_of_slot_prev:  used for a doubly-linked list
          of all preferences (of any type) in that particular slot

      all_of_goal_next, all_of_goal_prev:  used for a doubly-linked list
          of all preferences supported by this particular match goal.
          This is needed in order to remove all o-support from a particular
          goal when that goal is removed from the context stack.

      next_clone, prev_clone:  used for a doubly-linked list of all "clones"
        of this preference.  When a result is returned from a subgoal and a
        chunk is built, we get two copies of the "same" preference, one from
        the subgoal's production firing, and one from the chunk instantiation.
        If results are returned more than one level, or the same result is
        returned simultaneously by multiple production firings, we can get
        lots of copies of the "same" preference.  These clone preferences
        are kept on a list so that we can find the right one to backtrace
        through, given a wme supported by "all the clones."

      inst:  points to the instantiation that generated this preference

      inst_next, inst_prev:  used for a doubly-linked list of all
        existing preferences that were generated by that instantiation

      next_candidate:  used by the decider for lists of candidate values
        for a certain slot

      next_result:  used by the chunker for a list of result preferences

   Reference counts on preferences:
      +1 if the preference is currently in TM
      +1 for each instantiation condition that points to it (bt.trace)
      +1 if it supports an installed context WME

   We deallocate a preference if:
      (1) reference_count==0 and all its clones have reference_count==0
          (hence it couldn't possibly be needed anymore)
   or (2) its match goal is removed from the context stack
          (hence there's no way we'll ever want to BT through it)

        JUSTIFICATION_PRODUCTION_TYPE.

      declared_support:  indicates whether the production was declared
        :o-support or :i-support.  This field is either UNDECLARED_SUPPORT,
        DECLARED_O_SUPPORT, or DECLARED_I_SUPPORT.

      trace_firings:  TRUE iff a (pwatch) has been set on this production.

      p_node:  If the production is currently in the Rete, this points to
        the corresponding p_node in the Rete.  If the production is not in
        the Rete, this field is NIL.

      action_list:  singly-linked list of the RHS actions of the production.

      rhs_unbound_variables:  A (consed) list of variables used on the RHS
        that aren't bound on the LHS, in the order of their indices (for
        rhs_values).  For chunks, this is NIL, since we discard chunk
        variable names.

      instantiations:  header for a doubly-linked list of the instantiations
        of this production that are currently in the match set (i.e.,
        Rete-supported).

      OPERAND_which_assert_list: (BUGBUG need info from REW or RCHONG)

			interrupt: TRUE iff we should break when this production matches 
			            (but before it fires).  Note: this functionality is
									only used when the compile time option:
									MATCHTIME_INTERRUPT is defined.

   Reference counts on productions:
      +1 if it's in production memory (i.e., hasn't been excised)
      +1 for each existing instantiation pointing to it
   We deallocate a production if its reference_count goes to 0.

                        Instantiations and Nots

   Instantiations record three main things:
     (1) the instantiated LHS of the production,
     (2) any "<>" tests that are between identifiers and that occur in
         top-level positive conditions on the LHS, and
     (3) the still-existing preferences that were generated by the RHS.

   Fields in an instantiation:
 
      prod:  points to the production.  (Note: this can also be NIL, for
        fake instantiations used for goal ^item augmentations.  See decide.c.)

      next, prev:  used for a doubly-linked list of instantiations of this
        production that are still in the match set.

      rete_token, rete_wme:  these fields are reserved for use by the Rete.
        (The Rete needs them to find the proper instantiation to retract
        when a token is delted from a p_node.)

      top_of_instantiated_conditions, bottom_of_instantiated_conditions:
        point to the top and bottom of the instantiated LHS conditions.

      nots:  header of a singly-linked list of Nots from the LHS.

      preferences_generated:  header for a doubly-linked list of existing
        preferences that were created by this instantiation.

      match_goal:  points to the match goal of the instantiation, or NIL
        if there is none.

      match_goal_level:  goal stack level of the match goal, or
        ATTRIBUTE_IMPASSE_LEVEL if there is no match goal.

      okay_to_variablize:  TRUE iff it's okay to variablize a
        chunk/justification formed by backtracing through this instantiation.
        This is used to make sure we don't variablize a chunk that got formed
        by backtracing through some other justification.

      in_ms:  TRUE iff this instantiation is still in the match set (i.e.,
        Rete-supported).
      backtrace_number:  used by the chunker to avoid backtracing through
        the same instantiation twice during the building of the same chunk.

      GDS_evaluated_already:  Most productions produce several actions.
        When we compute the goal-dependency-set (gds) gds for one wme of an
        instantiation, there's no point in redoing the work for a second wme
        from the same instantiation since the gds will be the same.  By
        testing this flag, we avoid duplicating this work.  The value is set
        to FALSE whenever an instantiation is created. 

   Reference counts on instantiations:
      +1 if it's in the match set
      +1 for each preference it created that's still around
   The reference count is kept implicitly using the preferences_generated
   and in_ms fields.  We deallocate an instantiation if its reference count
   goes to 0.

             Global System Parameters and Related Definitions

   A set of system parameters (sysparam's for short) affect many operations
   of Soar, including learning, tracing, deciding, etc.  In order to
   provide a simple, uniform update mechanism (a single callback routine that
   gets called when any parameter changes), we store these parameters in
   an array sysparams[].  Below, we #define various indices into this array
   corresponding to various system parameters.

   Most of the parameters are of type "long".  A few parameters are more
   naturally handled as lists; for these, the array value is just a dummy,
   and callback routines must inspect a global variable to get the real 
   value.  Chunk_free_problem_spaces is an example of this.

   The array of sysparams[] can be read directly, but should be modified
   ONLY via calls to set_sysparam(), which is defined in init-soar.c.

                Working Memory Management and Utility Routines

   Reset_wme_timetags() resets the wme timetag generator back to 1.
   This should be called during an init-soar.

   Make_wme() creates and returns a new wme.  The caller should add the
   wme onto the appropriate dll (e.g., my_slot->wmes) and should call
   add_wme_to_wm() on it.

   Add_wme_to_wm() and remove_wme_from_wm() make changes to WM.  Again,
   the caller is responsible for manipulating the appropriate dll.  WM
   changes don't actually get stuffed down the rete until the end of the
   phase, when do_buffered_wm_and_ownership_changes() gets be called.

   Remove_wme_list_from_wm() is a utility routine that scans through a
   list of wmes, linked by their "next" fields, and calls remove_wme_from_wm()
   on each one.

   Wme_add_ref() and wme_remove_ref() are macros for incrementing and
   decrementing the reference count on a wme.  Deallocate_wme() deallocates
   a wme; this should only be invoked via the wme_remove_ref() macro.

   do_buffered_link_changes() to update the goal stack level of all
   identifiers, and garbage collect anything that's now disconnected.

   incrementing and decrementing the reference count on a preference.
   
   Possibly_deallocate_preference_and_clones() checks whether a given
   preference and all its clones have reference_count 0, and deallocates
   them all if they do; it returns TRUE if they were actually deallocated,
   FALSE otherwise.   Deallocate_preference() deallocates a given
   preference.  These routines should normally be invoked only via the
   preference_remove_ref() macro.

   Add_preference_to_tm() adds a given preference to preference memory (and
   hence temporary memory).  Remove_preference_from_tm() removes a given
   preference from PM and TM.

   Process_o_rejects_and_deallocate_them() handles the processing of
   o-supported reject preferences.  This routine is called from the firer
   and passed a list of all the o-rejects generated in the current
   preference phase (the list is linked via the "next" fields on the
   preference structures).  This routine removes all preferences for
   matching values from TM, and deallocates the o-reject preferences when
   done.

                             interface.c                             

  This portion of the code is normally replaced by the Tcl interface
  and interface support routines, but some maintenance continues, in
  the event someone needs to build a version without Tcl.  However some
  user interface commands are likely to break or give unusual output.

  User Interface Command Routines:

     Each user interface command has a corresponding function
     (user_interface_routine) to handle it.  These commands/functions
     should be installed at system startup time via add_command().  The
     command name string passed to add_command() must be permanently
     available (e.g., a constant in global data memory).

     When a user interface routine is called, the current lexeme is the
     command name.  The function should call the lexer to read its arguments,
     etc.  If successful, the function should return TRUE and should exit
     with the current lexeme being the closing right parenthesis (otherwise
     the dispatching function will print an error message about extra
     arguments being given).  If unsuccessful, the function should
     return FALSE.

  Dispatching commands:

     Dispatch_command() dispatches the appropriate user interface routine
     for the current command (i.e., the command named by the current lexeme).
     It calls set_lexer_allow_ids(TRUE) before dispatching the command,
     so if the command doesn't allow id's, it should call 
     set_lexer_allow_ids(FALSE) immediately.  Dispatch_command() returns 
     TRUE if the command was successful, FALSE if any error occurred.
   
     Repeatedly_read_and_dispatch_commands() keeps calling dispatch_command()
     until end-of-file is reached on the current input file.
     
     Load_file() sets up the lexer to read from a given open file, executes
     all the commands in that file, and then restore the lexer to reading
     the previous file.

  Help Information:

     Add_help() should be called at system startup time to specify to the
     "help" command what help info is available.  It takes a topic name and
     an array of lines of text for the helpscreen.  All these strings
     should be permanently available (e.g., constants in global data memory).

    Printing with an Optional Log File and with Redirection to a File

   We want to print stuff not only to the screen but also to a log
   file (if one is currently being used).  The print_string(), print(),
   print_with_symbols(), and print_spaces() routines do this.

   Start_log_file() and stop_log_file() open and close the current log
   file.  Print_string_to_log_file_only() is called by the lexer to
   echo keyboard input to the log file (it's already on the screen, so
   we don't want to print it there too).

   Print_string() and print_spaces() do the obvious things.
   Print() is exactly like printf() in C, except it prints to both
   the screen and log file (if there is one).  Print_with_symbols()
   is sort of like print, but only takes two kinds of escape sequences
   in the format string: 
       %y  -- print a symbol
       %%  -- print a "%" sign

   Sometimes we need to know the current output column so we can put
   a line break in the right place.  Get_printer_output_column() returns
   the current column number (1 means the start of the line). 
   Tell_printer_that_output_column_has_been_reset () is called from the
   lexer every time it reads a line from the keyboard--since after the
   user types a line (and hits return) the output column is reset.

   We also support temporarily redirecting all printing output to
   another file.  This is done by calling start_redirection_to_file()
   and stop_redirection_to_file().  In between these calls, all screen
   and log file output is turned off, and printing is done only to the
   redirection file.

                String to Escaped String Conversion
           {Symbol, Test, RHS Value} to String Conversion

   These routines produce strings.  Each takes an optional parameter "dest"
   which, if non-nil, points to the destination buffer for the result string.
   If dest is nil, these routines use a global buffer, and return a pointer
   to it.  (Otherwise "dest" itself is returned.)  Note that a single global
   buffer is shared by all three routines, so callers should assume the
   buffer will be destroyed by the next call to these routines with dest=NIL.

   String_to_escaped_string() takes a string and a first/last char,
   and produces an "escaped string" representation of the string; i.e.,
   a string that uses '\' escapes to include special characters.
   For example, input 'ab"c' with first/last character '"' yields
   '"ab\"c"'.  This is used for printing quoted strings and for printing
   symbols using |vbar| notation.
 
   Symbol_to_string() converts a symbol to a string.  The "rereadable"
   parameter indicates whether a rereadable representation is desired.
   Normally symbols are printed rereadably, but for (write) and Text I/O,
   we don't want this.

   Test_to_string() takes a test and produces a string representation.

   Rhs_value_to_string() takes an rhs_value and produces a string
   representation.  The rhs_value MUST NOT be a reteloc.

   parameter, if TRUE, indicates that the condition list should be printed
   in internal format--one condition per line, without grouping all the
   conditions for the same id into one line.

   Print_action_list() is similar except it prints actions instead of

                      Transitive Closure Utilities
               Marking, Unmarking, and Collecting Symbols

   Get_new_tc_number() is called from lots of places.  Any time we need
   to mark a set of identifiers and/or variables, we get a new tc_number
   by calling this routine, then proceed to mark various ids or vars
   by setting the sym->id.tc_num or sym->var.tc_num fields.

   Sometimes in addition to marking symbols using their tc_num fields,
   we also want to build up a list of the symbols we've marked.  So,
   the routines here take an "id_list" or "var_list" argument.  This
   argument should be NIL if no such list is desired.  If non-NIL, it
   should point to the header of the linked list being built.

       Transitive Closure Calculations for Conditions and Actions

   Usage: 
     1. Set my_tc = get_new_tc_number() to start a new TC
     2. (optional) If you want linked lists of symbols in the TC, initialize
        id_list=NIL and var_list=NIL.
        If you're not using id_list and/or var_list, give NIL for "&id_list"
        and/or "&var_list" in the function calls below.
     3. (optional) setup any id's or var's that you want to include in the
        initial TC, by calling 
           add_symbol_to_tc (sym, my_tc, &id_list, &var_list)
        (If not using id_list or var_list, you can just mark
         sym->{id,var}.tc_num = my_tc instead.)
     4. To do the work you want, use any of the following any number of times:
            add_cond_to_tc (cond, my_tc, &id_list, &var_list);
            add_action_to_tc (cond, my_tc, &id_list, &var_list);
            result = cond_is_in_tc (cond, my_tc);
            result = action_is_in_tc (action, my_tc);
     5. When finished, free the cons cells in id_list and var_list (but
        don't call symbol_remove_ref() on the symbols in them).

   when variablizing a chunk, we don't want to introduce a new variable that
   conincides with the name of a variable already in an NCC in the chunk.
   
   To use these routines, first call reset_variable_generator(), giving
   it lists of conditions and actions whose variables should not be
   used.  Then call generate_new_variable() any number of times; each
   time, you give it a string to use as the prefix for the new variable's

                         Production Management
 
    For each type of production, we maintain a doubly-linked list of
    all productions of that type.  The headers of these dll's are
    stored in the array all_productions_of_type[].  Another array,
    num_productions_of_type[], keeps counts of how many productions
    there are of each type.

    Production_add_ref() and production_remove_ref() are macros for
    incrementing and decrementing the reference count on a production.
    Production_remove_ref() also deallocates the production if the
    count goes to 0.
    
    Make_production() does reordering, compile-time o-support calc's,
    and builds and returns a production structure for a new production.
    It does not enter the production into the Rete net, however.
    The "type" argument should be one of USER_PRODUCTION_TYPE, etc.
    The flag "reorder_nccs" tells whether to recursively reorder
    the subconditions of NCC's--this is not necessary for newly
    built chunks, as their NCC's are copies of other NCC's in SP's that
    have already been reordered.  If any error occurs, make_production()
    returns NIL.

   All_wmes_in_rete is the header for a dll of all the wmes currently
   in the rete.  (This is normally equal to all of WM, except at times
   when WM changes have been buffered but not yet done.)  The wmes
   are linked via their "rete_next" and "rete_prev" fields.
   Num_wmes_in_rete counts how many wmes there are in the rete.

   Init_rete() initializes the rete.  It should be called at startup time.

   Any_assertions_or_retractions_ready() returns TRUE iff there are any
   pending changes to the match set.  This is used to test for quiescence.
   Get_next_assertion() retrieves a pending assertion (returning TRUE) or
   returns FALSE is no more are available.  Get_next_retraction() is
   similar.

   Add_production_to_rete() adds a given production, with a given LHS,
   to the rete.  If "refracted_inst" is non-NIL, it should point to an
   initial instantiation of the production.  This routine returns one
   of NO_REFRACTED_INST, REFRACTED_INST_MATCHED, etc. (see below).
   Excise_production_from_rete() removes the given production from the
   rete, and enqueues all its existing instantiations as pending
   retractions.

   Add_wme_to_rete() and remove_wme_from_rete() inform the rete of changes
   to WM.

   P_node_to_conditions_and_nots() takes a p_node and (optionally) a
   token/wme pair, and reconstructs the (optionally instantiated) LHS
   for the production.  The firer uses this to build the instantiated
   conditions; the printer uses it to reconstruct the LHS for printing.
   Get_symbol_from_rete_loc() takes a token/wme pair and a location
   specification (levels_up/field_num), examines the match (token/wme),
   and returns the symbol at that location.  The firer uses this for
   resolving references in RHS actions to variables bound on the LHS.

   Count_rete_tokens_for_production() returns a count of the number of 
   tokens currently in use for the given production.

   Print_partial_match_information(), print_match_set(), and
   the API function soar_ecPrintReteStatistics(),
   do printouts for various interface routines.

   Save_rete_net() and load_rete_net() are used for the fastsave/load
   commands.  They save/load everything to/from the given (already open)
   files.  They return TRUE if successful, FALSE if any error occurred.

   Object and stack trace formats are managed by this module.

   Init_tracing() initializes the tables; at this point, there are no trace
   formats for anything.  This routine should be called at startup time.

   Trace formats are changed by calls to add_trace_format() and
   remove_trace_format().  Add_trace_format() returns TRUE if the
   format was successfully added, or FALSE if the format string didn't
   parse right.  Remove_trace_format() returns TRUE if a trace format
   was actually removed, or FALSE if there was no such trace format for
   the given type/name restrictions.  These routines take a "stack_trace"
   argument, which should be TRUE if the stack trace format is intended,
   or FALSE if the object trace format is intended.  Their
   "type_restriction" argument should be one of FOR_ANYTHING_TF, ...,
   FOR_OPERATORS_TF.  The "name_restriction" argument should be either
   a pointer to a symbol, if the trace format is  restricted to apply
   to objects with that name, or NIL if the format can apply to any object.
   
   Print_all_trace_formats() prints out either all existing stack trace
   or object trace formats.

   Print_object_trace() takes an object (any symbol).  It prints the
   trace for that object.  Print_stack_trace() takes a (context)
   object (the state or op), the current state, the "slot_type"
   (one of FOR_OPERATORS_TF, etc.), and a flag indicating whether to
   allow %dc and %ec escapes (this flag should normally be TRUE for

                            Input Functions
 
   Input functions take one parameter--a mode (integer) indicating why the 
   function is being called.  The mode is either TOP_STATE_JUST_CREATED, 
   NORMAL_INPUT_CYCLE, or TOP_STATE_JUST_REMOVED.  In the input cycle
   immediately following the installation of the top state, each input
   function is called once with TOP_STATE_JUST_CREATED and then once with
   NORMAL_INPUT_CYCLE.  In the input cycle immediately following the removal
   of the top state, the functions are called with TOP_STATE_JUST_REMOVED.
   If the top state is *replaced*, the functions are called with 
   TOP_STATE_JUST_REMOVED, then TOP_STATE_JUST_CREATED, and then
   NORMAL_INPUT_CYCLE.

   Input routines create, modify, and delete input structures via calls
   to add_input_wme() and remove_input_wme().  The arguments to add_input_wme()
   indicate the id/attr/value components of the wme to be added.  Each of
   these components must be either (1) the current value of the global
   variable "top_state", or (2) the returned value from a call to 
   get_new_io_identifier(), get_io_sym_constant(), get_io_int_constant(),
   or get_io_float_constant().  [The idea behind creating the components this
   way is to avoid having I/O functions deal with the reference counts on
   symbols.]  For every call an I/O function makes to get_xxx(), it should
   later call release_io_symbol().  Release_io_symbol() should *not* be
   called with the value of "top_state"--*only* the components obtained via
   get_xxx().
   
   The add_input_wme() routine returns a pointer to the wme added.  The input
   routine shouldn't use this pointer in any way except to save it around for
   a later call to remove_input_wme().  Example:

         float current_sensor_value;
         wme *w;
         Symbol *s1,*s2;
         ... insert code to read value into current_sensor_value here ...
         s1 = get_io_sym_constant ("sensor-value");
         s2 = get_io_float_constant (current_sensor_value);
         ... add to working memory (S1 ^sensor-value 37.5) ...
         w = add_input_wme (top_state, s1, s2);
         release_io_symbol (s1);
         release_io_symbol (s2);
   
   On some later call, the input function might call remove_input_wme (w)
   to remove (S1 ^sensor-value 37.5) from working memory.

   To remove an entire input structure, it is sufficient for the input
   function to call remove_input_wme() on just the top link wme.  The input
   function need not call remove_input_wme() on each and every wme in the
   structure.  (Soar automagically garbage collects all the wmes in the
   now-disconnected structure.)  Note that when an input function is called
   with TOP_STATE_JUST_REMOVED, all existing input structures have already
   been garbage collected (since the top state no longer exists), so the 
   input function should never call remove_input_wme() when mode is
   TOP_STATE_JUST_REMOVED.  Remove_input_wme() normally returns TRUE,
   indicating success.  It returns FALSE if an error occurs (e.g., if the
   wme argument isn't in WM).

                            Output Functions
 
   Output functions take two parameters--a mode (integer) indicating why the 
   function is being called, and a pointer to a chain of io_wme structures.
   The mode is either ADDED_OUTPUT_COMMAND (used when an output link is first
   created), MODIFIED_OUTPUT_COMMAND (used when the transitive closure of an
   existing link changes), or REMOVED_OUTPUT_COMMAND (used when the output
   link is removed from working memory).

   The chain of io_wme structures is connected via the "next" fields in the
   structures; for the last io_wme, next==NIL.  When mode is either
   ADDED_OUTPUT_COMMAND or MODIFIED_OUTPUT_COMMAND, this chain contains
   all the wmes in the current transitive closure of the output link
   (including the output link wme itself).  When mode is
   REMOVED_OUTPUT_COMMAND, the chain consists of just one io_wme--the top-level
   ouput link being removed.
  
   Output functions should inspect the io_wme chain and take whatever
   actions are appropriate.  Note that Soar deallocates the io_wme chain
   after calling the output function, so the output function is responsible
   for saving any necessary information around for later.
   
   How can an output function examine the io_wme's?  The io_wme structures
   indicate the id/attr/value of the wmes in the output structure.  See
   the comments above for symtab.c for an explanation of the structure
   of these symbols.

   Get_output_value() is a simple utility routine for finding things in
   an io_wme chain.  It takes "outputs" (the io_wme chain), and "id" and
   "attr" (symbols to match against the wmes), and returns the value from
   the first wme in the chain with a matching id and attribute.  Either
   "id" or "attr" (or both) can be specified as "don't care" by giving
   NULL (0) pointers for them instead of pointers to symbols.  If no matching
   wme is found, the function returns a NULL pointer.

    /* ----------------------- Timing statistics -------------------------- */

/* 
For Soar 7, the timing code has been completely revamped.  When the compile
flag NO_TIMING_STUFF is not set, statistics will be now be collected on the
total cpu time, total kernel time, time spent in the individual phases of a
decision cycle, time spent executing the input and output functions, and time
spent executing callbacks (or monitors).  When the DETAILED_TIMING_STATS flag
is set, additional statistics will be collected for ownership, match, and
chunking computations according to the phase in which they occur. (Notice
that DETAILED_TIMING_STATS can only be collected when NO_TIMING_STUFF is not
true.)

The total_cpu_time is turned on when one of the run_<x> functions is
initiated.  This timer is not turned off while the do_one_top_level_phase()
function is executing.  The total_kernel_time timer is turned on just after
the total_cpu_time timer and turned off just before the other is turned off.
This guarantees that the total kernel time -- including the time it takes to
turn on and off the kernel timer -- is a part of the total cpu time.  The
total_kernel_time is also turned off whenever a callback is initiated or when
the input and output functions are executing.

The decision_cycle_phase_timers measure the kernel time for each phase of the
decision cycle (ie, INPUT_PHASE, PREFERENCE_PHASE, WM_PHASE, OUTPUT_PHASE,
and DECISION_PHASE).  Each is turned on at the beginning of its corresponding
phase in do_one_top_level_phase and turned off at the end of that phase.
These timers are also turned off for callbacks and during the execution of
the input and output functions.

The monitors_cpu_time timers are also indexed by the current phase.  Whenever
a callback is initiated, both the total_kernel_time and
decision_cycle_phase_timer for the current phase are turned off and the
monitors_cpu_time turned on.  After the callback has terminated, the kernel
timers are turned back on.  Notice that the same relationship holds here as
it did between the total_cpu_time and total_kernel_time timers.  The
total_kernel_time is always turned off last and turned on first, in
comparison to the decision_cycle_phase_timer.  This means that turning the
decision_cycle_phase_timers on and off is included as part of the kernel time
and helps ensure that the total_kernel_time is always greater than the sum of
the decision_cycle_timers.

The input_function_cpu_time and output_function_cpu_time timers measure the
time it takes to execute the input and output functions respectively.  Both
the total_kernel_time and decision_cycle_phase_timers are turned off when
these timers are turned on (with the same ordering as discussed previously).
The input function is a little tricky.  Because add-wme can be called by the
input routine, which then calls do_buffered_wm_and_ownership_changes, we
can't just turn off the kernel timers for input and expect to get numbers for
both match_time (see next para) and kernel time.  The solution implemented in
the 28.07.96 changes is to not turn off the kernel timers until the actual
INPUT_PHASE_CALLBACK is initiated.  This takes care of all but direct
additions and removals of WMEs.  Since these are done through the add-wme and
remove-wme commands, the input_timer is turned off there was well, and the
kernel timers turned back on (for the buffered wm changes).  However, this is
a hack and may introduce problems when add-wme and remove-wme are used at the
command line or someplace in the decision cycle other than input (probably
rare but possible).

The DETAILED_TIMING_STATS flag enables collection of statistics on match,
ownership and chunking calculations performed in each part of the decision
cycle.  An 'other' value is reported which is simply the difference between
the sum of the deailed timers and the kernel timer for some pahse.  The other
value should always be greater than or equal to zero.

The "stats" command (in soarCommandUtils) has been updated to report these
new timing values.  The output is provided in a spreadsheet-style format to
display the information in a succinct form.  There are also some derived
totals in that report.  The derived totals in the right column are simply the
sum of the all the other columns in a particular row; for example, the
derived total for the first row, kernel time, is just the sum of all the
decision_cycle_phase_timers.  The derived totals in the bottom row are the
sum of all the basic timers in that row (i.e., no DETAILED statistics are
included in the sum).  For example, the derived total under input is equal to
the sum of decision_cycle_phase_timer and the monitors_time for the
INPUT_PHASE, and the input_function_cpu_time and represents the total time
spent in the input phase for the current run.  The number in the lower
right-hand corner is the sum of the derived totals above it in that right
column (and should always be equal to the numbers to the left of it in that
row).

Also reported with the stats command are the values of total_cpu_time and
total_kernel_time.  If the ordering discussed above is strictly enforced,
total_kernel_time should always be slightly greater than the derived total
kernel time and total_cpu_time greater than the derived total CPU time. REW */
