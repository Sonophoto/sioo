NAME
     run - Run Soar

SYNOPSIS
     run [_n | 'forever'] [_u_n_i_t] [-self]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     This command runs the Soar agents. If the  [-self]  flag  is
     issued,  only the agent issuing the run command will run.  _n
     is a single integer which specifies the number of  times  to
     run Soar.  If _n is unspecified and no _u_n_i_ts are given, OR if
     _n is the single keyword 'forever', then Soar is  run   until
     halted  by  problem-solving completion or an external inter-
     rupt.  If _n is specified, but no _u_n_i_ts are  specified,  then
     soar is run by decision cycles.  If _u_n_i_ts are specified, but
     _n is unspecified, then _n defaults to '1'.  The _u_n_i_t argument
     indicates  the  unit  of measure to be used in counting Soar
     run cycles.  _u_n_i_t must be one of the following keywords:

     p    run Soar for _n phases.  A  phase  is  either  an  input
          phase,  preference  phase, working memory phase, output
          phase, or decision phase.

     e    run Soar for _n elaboration cycles.   (For  purposes  of
          this  command, decision phase is counted as an elabora-
          tion cycle.)

     d    run Soar for _n decision cycles

     s    run Soar until the _nth time a state is selected

     o    run Soar until the _nth time an operator is selected

     out  run Soar until the _nth time output is generated by  the
          agent

     <s>  run Soar until the current level of subgoaling has ter-
          minated

     <ss> run Soar until the superstate's level of subgoaling has
          terminated

     <sss>
          run Soar until the supersuperstate's level of  subgoal-
          ing has terminated

     <o>  run Soar until the _nth time an operator is selected  at
          this  level of subgoaling or until the current level of

run(n)                    Soar Commands                    run(n)



          subgoaling is terminated.

     <so> run Soar until the _nth time a superoperator is selected
          or until that level of subgoaling is terminated.

     <sso>
          run Soar until the _nth  time  a  supersuperoperator  is
          selected  or  until  that  level  of subgoaling is ter-
          minated.

     Unlike the Soar 6 _g_o command, _r_u_n has no memory of  settings
     from previous run commands.

     There are two predefined aliases for the run  command,  pro-
     vided as a convenience for use on the command line:

     d [_n]
          run by decision cycles, equivalent to  "run  _n  d".   _n
          defaults to 1.

     e [_n]
          run by elaboration cycles, equivalent to "run _n e".   _n
          defaults to 1.



EXAMPLES
     run  run all agents until halted by problem-solving  comple-
          tion or an external interrupt is given.

     run 5 d
          run all agents for 5 decision cycles

     run d -self
          run the current agent only for 1 decision cycle

     run 3
          run all agents for 3 decision cycles

     run 2 e
          run all agents for 2 elaboration cycles

     run 1 s
          run all agents until the next state is selected  (i.e.,
          until the next time an impasse arises)

     run <so>
          run until the next superoperator is selected (or  until
          the superstate goes away)

     run 3 <o>
          run for 3 operator selections at this level (continuing

          through any subgoals that arise)


WARNING
     In Soar8, the preference phase is no longer  separated  from
     the  working memory phase, Soar continues right through from
     preferences  into  working  memory  without  stopping.   The
     phases  are  Input, Propose, Decide, Apply, Output;  Propose
     and Apply each consist of at least one, but  possibly  many,
     preference/working-memory subphases.
