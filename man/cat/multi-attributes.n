NAME
     multi-attributes - Declare a symbol to be multi-attributed

SYNOPSIS
     multi-attributes [_s_y_m_b_o_l [_n]]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     This command declares the given _s_y_m_b_o_l to  be  an  attribute
     which  can  take  on  multiple values.  The optional _n is an
     integer (>1) indicating an upper  limit  on  the  number  of
     expected  values that will appear for an attribute.  If _n is
     not specified, the  value  10  is  used  for  each  declared
     multi-attribute.   More  informed values will tend to result
     in greater efficiency.


     This command is used _o_n_l_y to provide hints to the production
     condition  reorderer so it can produce better condition ord-
     erings.  Better orderings enable the  Rete  network  to  run
     faster.   This  command has no effect on the actual contents
     of working memory and most users needn't use this at all.


WARNING
     Note that multi-attributes declarations must be made  _b_e_f_o_r_e
     productions are loaded into production
