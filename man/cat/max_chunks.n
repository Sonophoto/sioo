NAME
     max_chunks - Set or list the maximum chunk count

SYNOPSIS
     set max_chunks [_c_o_u_n_t]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     max_chunks is a Soar variable which,  through  the  Tcl  _s_e_t
     command,  sets  and prints the maximum number of chunks that
     can be created in one  decision  cycle.   If  _c_o_u_n_t  is  not
     given,  'set max_chunks' prints the maximum number of chunks
     that can be created.  If _c_o_u_n_t is given, it must be a  posi-
     tive  integer  and  is  used  to  reset the number of chunks
     allowed.

     The "max_chunks" parameter controls the  maximum  number  of
     chunks  that  can  be  created  in  a single decision cycle.
     After this limit has been reached in a decision cycle,  Soar
     proceeds  to decision phase even if quiescence hasn't really
     been reached  yet.   The  default  initial  setting  of  the
     "max_chunks" variable is 50.
