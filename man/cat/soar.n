NAME
     soar - Soar system

SYNOPSIS
     soar [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     This command creates new  Soar  interpreters  identified  by
     given  _n_a_m_es.   The various options specify any special ini-
     tialization conditions, if any.  The most  important  option
     is  the  _t_y_p_e which indicates what type of interpreter is to
     be created and must be one of the following values:

     -agent
          Create agent interpreter(s).  This includes Tcl + Soar.

     -tclsh
          Create tclsh interpreter(s).  Tclsh includes only Tcl.

     One or more _n_a_m_es may be given after the above _t_y_p_es.  If no
     _t_y_p_e  is  given  on the command line when Soar is invoked, a
     single -agent interpreter is created  with  the  _n_a_m_e  soar.
     Within  Soar,  it  is  an error to call this command without
     specifying some interpreter _n_a_m_e to create.

     Once the Soar system has started, the command  create-interp
     can be used to add additional interpreters.


OPTIONS
     Environment variables used below are assumed to  be  defined
     in the Unix shell used to start Soar.

     -path
          Use the given sequence of directories to scan for agent
          initialization  files.   The  sequence  is  a colon (:)
          separated list of directories.  The  default  value  is
          ".:$HOME",  where  $HOME  is the user's home directory.
          Agent initialization files  are  assumed  to  be  named
          _n_a_m_e.soar.

     -file
          Specifies a file to run immediately after defining  the
          last  interpreter.   This  only  applies  when invoking
          Soar.

     -help
          Lists all available options for this command.

     -verbose
          Print diagnostic  information  about  options  as  each
          interpreter is defined.


EXAMPLES
     The following example starts Soar with two agents named fred
     and  wilma  and  a  single  tclsh interpreter named bedrock.
     This setup might be used to run a  simulator  in  the  tclsh
     interpreter  bedrock  that  the  agents  fred  and wilma can
     interact in.

          soar -agent fred wilma -tclsh bedrock

     This example has the extra option -foo bar.  Since  this  is
     not  recognized as a valid command line option, it is passed
     on to each interpreter defined on the  command  line.   This
     information appears in the Tcl variable argv and can be used
     to pass startup information to user-defined Tcl procedures.

          soar -foo bar -agent fred wilma -wish bedrock
