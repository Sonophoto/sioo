NAME
     d - Run Soar by decision cycles

SYNOPSIS
     d [_c_y_c_l_e_s]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     d is actually a predefined alias for 'run [n] d' which  runs
     the  Soar agent for the given number of decision _c_y_c_l_e_s.  If
     no cycles are given, then the agent is run for one  decision
     cycle.   'd   -1'   or  'd forever' runs the agent until the
     task terminates or a user interrupt is given.
