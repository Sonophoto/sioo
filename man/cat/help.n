NAME
     help - Print man pages for Soar commands

SYNOPSIS
     help [-all | _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_n_a_m_e [-usage]]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     This command prints the formatted manual page for the  given
     _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_n_a_m_e.   Soar's  help  facility  is able to do command
     completion, so as long as a unique substring of the command-
     name is specified, Soar will find and display the help page.

     Under the TSI (Tcl-Soar Interface, a graphical interface  to
     Soar), the help will pop up a separate window to display the
     text.

     Under Unix with no TSI running, the help command attempts to
     locate  a  pager  program to use to display help pages page-
     by-page since some are longer than a  typical  screen.   The
     command first examines the environment variable PAGER to see
     if the user has defined a preference there.  If that is  not
     present,  the  help  system checks to see if one of the com-
     monly used pagers "less", "more", or "page" is available (in
     that  order).   If no pager is available, then an error mes-
     sage is given.  If no pagers exist on your system, then  you
     can set the environment variable PAGER to "cat" and the help
     pages will simply be cat'ed to the screen.  Since some pages
     are  long,  this  will  make  it difficult to read an entire
     page.


OPTIONS
     -all List all commands for which help is available

     -usage
          List only the SYNOPSIS section of the man  page.   This
          includes  the  abbreviated  syntax  for the command.  -
          usage may not work properly on  some  windows  and  mac
          systems.


FILES
     The nroff sources for the manual pages  are  stored  in  the
     subdirectory  .../doc/man.  These files are used to generate
     the  "cat"  and  "HTML"  versions  which   are   stored   in
     .../doc/cat and .../doc/html, respectively.

ENVIRONMENT
     PAGER

          This variable contains the user's preferred paging pro-
          gram  which shows text page by page rather than spewing
          all text at once to standard  output.   Typical  pagers
          are more, less, and page.


WARNINGS
     Some pages, such as less clear the screen upon exit,  remov-
     ing the help page from view.  If you wish to retain the help
     page, use a pager such as more.
