NAME
     firing-counts - Print production firing counts

SYNOPSIS
     firing-counts [_i_n_t_e_g_e_r | _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n-_n_a_m_e_s]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     This command prints information  about  production  firings.
     If  an option is not given, then all productions are printed
     in a sorted list according  to  how  many  times  they  have
     fired.


OPTIONS
     If given, an option can take one of two forms -- an  integer
     or a list of production names:

     _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
          List the top _i_n_t_e_g_e_r productions.   If  _i_n_t_e_g_e_r  is  0,
          only the productions which haven't fired are listed.

     _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n-_n_a_m_e_s
          For each production in _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n-_n_a_m_e_s, print how many
          times the production has fired.


EXAMPLES
     This example prints the 10 productions which have fired  the
     most times along with their firing counts:

          firing-counts 10
9
     This  example  prints  the  firing  counts  of   productions
     my*first*production and my*second*production:

          firing-counts my*first*production my*second*production
9

WARNINGS
     firing-counts are reset to zero after an init-soar

     NB:  This command is slow, because the  sorting  takes  time
     O(n*log n)
