NAME
     learn - Control the learning of productions

SYNOPSIS
     learn [-_o_n | -_o_f_f | -_e_x_c_e_p_t | -_o_n_l_y | -_l_i_s_t | -_a_l_l-_l_e_v_e_l_s  |

DESCRIPTION
     This command is used to control the learning (or "chunking")
     of  productions.  With no arguments, this command prints out
     the current learning environment status.  The watch  command
     can be used to provide various levels of detail when produc-
     tions are learned.

     Learning is on by default.


OPTIONS
     Any _o_p_t_i_o_ns given must match one of the following keywords:

     -on  turn learning on

     -off turn all learning off

     -except
          learning is on, except as specified by  RHS  dont-learn
          actions

     -only
          learning is off, except as specified by RHS force-learn
          actions

     -list
          lists the force-learn and dont-learn states  registered
          by the RHS actions


     -all-levels
          when learning is on, this allows  learning  whenever  a
          subgoal  returns  a  result  (in  contrast to bottom-up
          learning)

     -bottom-up
          when learning is on, this allows learning at  only  the
          lowest level; i.e., build chunks only for subgoals that
          have not yet had any subgoals with chunks built.
