NAME
     alias - Define a new Soar alias

SYNOPSIS
     alias [_n_a_m_e [_d_e_f_i_n_i_t_i_o_n | -_o_f_f]]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     This command defines new aliases by creating Tcl  procedures
     with  the  given  _n_a_m_e.   The new procedure can then take an
     arbitrary number of arguments which are post-pended  to  the
     given  _d_e_f_i_n_i_t_i_o_n and then that entire string is executed as
     a command.  When invoked, the command  is  executed  at  the
     global  level  as  if  typed in from the interactive command
     line interpreter.  The _d_e_f_i_n_i_t_i_o_n must be a single  command,
     ';'  for  multiple commands is not allowed.  If more complex
     aliases are desired, then the Tcl proc command can  be  used
     to  define  a  new procedure.  The alias procedure checks to
     see if the _n_a_m_e already exists, and does not destroy  exist-
     ing procedures or aliases by the same name.

     Existing  aliases  can  be  removed  by  using  the  command
     unalias, or by specifying  alias _n_a_m_e -_o_f_f.

     With  no  arguments,  alias  returns  the  list  of  defined
     aliases.

     With only the _n_a_m_e given, alias returns the current  defini-
     tion.



EXAMPLES
     The command wmes is an alias which is defined as follows:

          alias wmes print -depth 0 -internal
9
     If the user executes a command such as:

          wmes {(* ^superstate nil)}
9
     it is as if the user had typed this command:

          print -depth 0 -internal {(* ^superstate nil)}
9

      Alias is also a Tcl command  that  is  used  when  creating
     slave interps.  In Tcl, it is used to allow slave interps to
     call procs that are defined in the master interp.   See  the
     Tcl help file in your system.



FILES
     soar.tcl and soar7.2km-aliases.tcl

          The aliases for Soar provided upon startup are  defined
          in   these   files.   The  files  are  located  in  the
          $soar_library directory (folder).
