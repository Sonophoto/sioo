NAME
     max-elaborations - Set  or  list  the  maximum  elaborations
     allowed

SYNOPSIS
     max-elaborations [_c_o_u_n_t]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     This command sets and prints the maximum number of  elabora-
     tion  cycles  allowed.   If _c_o_u_n_t is not given, this command
     prints the current number of elaboration cycles allowed.  If
     _c_o_u_n_t is given, it must be a positive integer and is used to
     reset the number of allowed elaboration cycles.

     The "max-elaborations" parameter controls the maximum number
     of  elaborations  allowed in a single decision cycle.  After
     this limit has been reached, Soar moves on to the next phase
     and  a warning message is printed.  The default initial set-
     ting of the "max-elaborations" parameter is 100.

     In Soar8, max-elaborations is checked during both  the  Pro-
     pose Phase and the Apply Phase.  If Soar8 runs more than the
     max-elaborations limit in  either  of  these  phases,  Soar8
     proceeds  to the next phase (either Decision or Output) even
     if quiescence has not been reached.

EXAMPLES
     The command issued with no arguments, returns the  max  ela-
     borations allowed:

          max-elaborations
9
     The next example makes use of Tcl command abbreviation while
     setting the maximum value to 50:

          max-e  50

VARIABLE
     Note that the commandname uses dashes to separate the words.
     There  is  also  a  Soar  variable  "max_elaborations" (with
     underscores) that can be used to set the limit  through  the
     the   Tcl   _s_e_t  command.   If  _c_o_u_n_t  is  not  given,  'set
     max_elaborations' prints the current number  of  elaboration
     cycles  allowed.   If  _c_o_u_n_t is given, it must be a positive
     integer and is used to reset the number of allowed  elabora-
     tion cycles.
