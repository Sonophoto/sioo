DESCRIPTION
     This command, which should not normally be called by the
     user or an agent (attention lapses normally get started
     automatically by the architecture), sets the "attention-lapsing"
     variable to TRUE (1), and starts tracking the amount of real
     time that should pass before ending the lapse (with
     wake_from_attention_lapse).  The duration of the lapse is
     the number of milleseconds specified by the argument to this
     command (in real time).
