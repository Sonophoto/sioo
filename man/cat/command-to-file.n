NAME
     command-to-file - Evaluate the command and print  result  to
     file

SYNOPSIS
     command-to-file _c_o_m_m_a_n_d _f_i_l_e [_m_o_d_e]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     This evaluates a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d in the  current  interpreter.   The
     prints  issued  by the command and its result (both of which
     are normally printed to stdout) are redirected to the  given
     _f_i_l_e.   The  _m_o_d_e  determines  whether the file is initially
     opened in write (-new) or append  (-existing)  mode.  If  no
     _m_o_d_e is given, then -new is assumed.


EXAMPLES
     The command writes all productions to the file my-file:

          command-to-file list-productions my-file
9
     This command appends the memory statistics  to  the  already
     existing file my-stats-file:

          command-to-file {stats -memory} my-stats-file -existing
