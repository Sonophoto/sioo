NAME

     preferences mode

SYNOPSIS
      set attribute_preferences_mode [_m_o_d_e]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     attribute_preferences_mode is a Soar variable which sets and
     prints  the  attributes preferences mode through the the Tcl
     _s_e_t command. If the  _m_o_d_e is not given, the Tcl _s_e_t  command
     prints  the  current attribute preferences mode.  If _m_o_d_e is
     given, it must be one of the positive integers 0,  1,  or  2
     and is used to reset the attribute preferences modes.

     The "attribute_preferences_mode" parameter is used  to  con-
     trol  the handling of preferences (other than acceptable and
     reject preferences) for non-context slots.   The  _m_o_d_e  set-
     tings have the following interpretations:

     0    Handle them the normal (Soar 6) way.

     1    Handle them the normal (Soar 6) way, but print a  warn-
          ing  message whenever a preference other than + or - is
          created for a non-context slot.

     2    Whenever a preferences other than + or - is created for
          a  non-context  slot, print an error message and ignore
          (discard) that preference.  For non-context slots,  the
          set  of  values  installed  in working memory is always
          equal to the set of acceptable values minus the set  of
          rejected values.

     The      default      initial      setting      of       the
     "attribute_preferences_mode" variable is 0.
