NAME
     Soar righthand side functions


DESCRIPTION
     Soar supports a number of functions which can appear on  the
     righthand  side  of productions.  These functions can appear
     either as values (such as the "int"  of  a  number),  or  as
     standalone  actions (such as "write" or "halt").  The right-
     hand side functions can be used to stop or  pause  Soar,  do
     text  input and output, execute mathematical functions, gen-
     erate and manipulate symbols, modify learning,  and  execute
     Tcl commands.

     The Soar User's Manual should be consulted for more informa-
     tion on the use of righthand side functions.


     The available righthand side functions are:

          accept
               suspends Soar's execution and waits for  the  user
               to type a constant, followed by a carriage return.
               The result of the accept is the constant.

          capitalize-symbol
               given a symbol, this function returns a new symbol
               with the first character capitalized.

          compute-heading
               given 4 args, x1  y1  and  x2  y2,  this  function
               returns integer heading from x1,y1 to x2,y2 (Note:
               this    function     is     defined     in     the
               interface/rhsfun_examples.c file)

          compute-range
               given 4 args, x1  y1  and  x2  y2,  this  function
               returns  integer  range from x1,y1 to x2,y2 (Note:
               this    function     is     defined     in     the
               interface/rhsfun_examples.c file)

          crlf short for "carriage return, line feed," this func-
               tion can be called only within _w_r_i_t_e.  It forces a
               newline at its position in the _w_r_i_t_e action.

          dont-learn
               when learning is set to _e_x_c_e_p_t, by default  chunks
               will  be formed in all states;  the dont-learn RHS
               action will cause learning to be  turned  off  for
               the state specified in the LHS (condition side) of

               the production.

          force-learn
               when learning is set to _o_n_l_y,  by  default  chunks
               are  not formed in any state;  the force-learn RHS
               action will cause learning to be turned on for the
               state specified in the LHS (condition side) of the
               production.

          halt terminates the current run, stops Soars  execution
               and  returns  to the user prompt.  halt should not
               be used if the current run  is  to  be  restarted.
               (see interrupt below.)

          ifeq checks if the first argument is "eq" to the second
               argument.   if  it is, then return the third argu-
               ment, else return the fourth argument.  Similar to
               the  "?"  notation  in  C.  all four arguments are
               required.

          interrupt
               causes Soar to stop at  the  end  of  the  current
               phase,  and return to the user prompt.  Similar to
               halt, except the run may be continued.

          make-constant-symbol
               returns a new constant symbol which is  guaranteed
               to be different from all symbols currently present
               in the system.  with no arguments,  it  returns  a
               symbol  whose  name  starts with "constant".  With
               one or more arguments,  it  takes  those  argument
               symbols,  concatenates  their  names  and uses the
               resulting string as the prefix for the new symbol.

          round-off
                Given two  numbers,  this  function  returns  the
               first   rounded  to  the  nearest  second  number.
               (Note:   this   function   is   defined   in   the
               interface/rhsfun_examples.c file)

          round-off-heading
                Given two  numbers,  this  function  returns  the
               first  rounded  to the nearest second number.  The
               heading  is  given  between  -180  and  +180  deg.
               (Note:   this   function   is   defined   in   the
               interface/rhsfun_examples.c file)

          strlen
               returns the length of the output  string  so  that
               users  can get the output to line up nicely.  use-
               ful with ifeq when the  output  string  varies  in
               length.

          timestamp
               returns a symbol whose print name is a representa-
               tion of the current date and local time.

          tcl  concatenates its arguments into a string which  is
               sent  to  the  agent's Tcl interpreter for evalua-
               tion.  It does  not  automatically  insert  spaces
               between  arguments;   users must explicitly insert
               spaces within vertical bars.

          write
               writes its arguments to the  user  interface.   it
               does  not automatically insert blanks, line feeds,
               or carriage returns.  It should be used  only  for
               simple monitoring and debugging.

          +    prefix notation for addition.   If  all  arguments
               are  integers,  this  function returns an integer,
               otherwise it returns a real number.

          *    prefix notation for multiplication.  If all  argu-
               ments  are  integers,  this  function  returns  an
               integer, otherwise it returns a real number.

          -    prefix notation for subtraction.  If all arguments
               are  integers,  this  function returns an integer,
               otherwise it returns a real number.

          /    prefix notation for  division.  always  returns  a
               real number.

          div  prefix  notation  for  binary  integer   division.
               returns the integer quotient.  Both arguments must
               be integers or an error occurs.

          mod  prefix  notation  for  binary   integer   modulus.
               returns  the  integer  remainder when dividing the
               first argument by the scond.  Both arguments  must
               be integers or an error occurs.

          sin  returns as a float, the sine of  the  angle  which
               must be given in radians.

          cos  returns as a float, the cosine of the angle  which
               must be given in radians.

          atan2
               returns as a float in radians, the  arctangent  of
               the first argument divided by the second argument.
               the arguments can be integers or floats.

          sqrt returns  as  a  float  the  square  root  of   its

               argument, which can be a float or an integer.

          abs  returns the absolute value: of a float as a float;
               of an integer as an integer.

          int  converts a symbol to an integer  constant.   argu-
               ment  must be either an integer constant, a float-
               ing point constant, or a symbolic  constant  which
               can be interpreted as a single integer number.

          float
               converts a symbol to an floating  point  constant.
               argument  must  be  either  an integer constant, a
               floating point constant, or  a  symbolic  constant
               which  can  be  interpreted  as  a single floating
               point number.

WARNINGS
     The tcl RHS function is not part of the Soar kernel.  It  is
     added  by the Tcl interface code.  You can get into a lot of
     trouble with it, as  the  arguments  are  unrestricted.   It
     should be used only with great care.
