.SH NAME
pwatch \- Trace production firings and retractions
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpwatch\fR [\fB-on\fR | \fB-off\fR] \fR[\fIproduction-name\fR*]
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command enables and disables the tracing of production activity for
individual productions.  Both firings and retractions are printed.
If no \fIproduction-name\fRs are given, this command lists the
productions currently being traced.  If one or more
\fIproduction-name\fRs are given, tracing is enabled (or disabled if
\fB-off\fR is specified) for those productions.  
Tracing persists until disabled or until the production is \fBexcise\fRd.
.PP
This command is orthogonal to the \fBwatch productions\fR mechanism.
See the \fBwatch\fR command for more information.
