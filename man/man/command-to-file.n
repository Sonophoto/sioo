.SH NAME
command-to-file \- Evaluate the command and print result to file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcommand-to-file\fR \fIcommand\fR \fIfile\fR [\fImode\fR]
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This evaluates a \fIcommand\fR in the current interpreter.
The prints issued by the command and its result (both of which
are normally printed to stdout) are redirected to the given
\fIfile\fR.  The \fImode\fR determines whether the file is
initially opened in write (\fB-new\fR) or append (\fB-existing\fR) 
mode. If no \fImode\fR is given, then \fB-new\fR is assumed.

.SH EXAMPLES

\fBcommand-to-file list-productions my-file\fR
.DE
.PP
