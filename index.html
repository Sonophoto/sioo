<p>SIOO is an embeddable cognitive architecture based on Soar 8.5.2
and includes that kernel and a handful of other files from the 
8.5.2 version of SoarSuite.</p>

<p><strong>We do NOT document Domain Modeling or Production Systems. Sorry.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Production Systems</strong> backgrounder:</p>

<p>Wikipedia has a decent article on "<em>Production Systems (Computer Science)</em>" if you need a starting point on how these types of software systems are used to model intelligent behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>Suggested Reading</strong> includes:</p>

<p><em>Unified Theories of Cognition</em> by Allen Newell (Harvard Press), and</p>

<p><em>The Soar Cognitive Architecture</em> by John Laird (MIT Press). </p>

<p>Note that you need to change to the build directory of the CLI system, and then run <code>sioo</code> from that directory or the system won't find the demos(this hassle is a listed bug). The demos do work and are run as commands in the CLI , the demos are named <code>counter-demo</code> and <code>toh-demo</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Missionaries and Cannibals Puzzle</strong>
There is a demo for the Missionaries and Cannibals puzzle that comes as a binary rete network dump. Again, starting in the sioo/cli directory, run <code>./SiOO</code> (start fresh from scratch) and try <code>rete-net -load agents/mac.rete</code> once it is loaded you can then run it, try 100 Decision Cycle groups: <code>run 100</code> run this command 3 to 7 times (it varies) to see the system solve the problem. Notice that it takes hundreds of steps. To watch it run straight through, try <code>init-soar</code> to reset the system and then do <code>run</code> by itself. The system will blaze through the puzzle leaving a trail of steps. </p>

<p><strong>Using Intelligence and Learning</strong>
Lets turn on the actual learning system, "chunking" and see what happens. try <code>learn -on</code>. Next type <code>learn</code> you should see a statement that says <em>learn -on</em>. Lets reinitialize the system to start all over from scratch with <code>init-soar</code>, now we are ready for the next step.</p>

<p>Learning changes the entire game in these toy domains. Now lets run the MaC simulation with learning on, try <code>run 100</code> you may or may not have to type it again. Note how many Decision Cycles(DC) it took to solve the problem. Now type <code>init-soar</code> again and do <code>run</code>. There is the magic number; once this domain is fully chunked, the system has found and remembered a set of rules that solves this configuration in optimal execution time.</p>

<p>Go to the <code>cli</code> directory and read the code. start at main.c. This is terrible advice, but the best available at this time.</p>

<p><strong>This is alpha code and is just now coming together.</strong></p>

<p>This code is NOT for beginners (at all) and is intended for experts with the C language, (gcc) *nix tools, production systems, the PSCM, FSMs, and Knowledge/Domain Modeling. There is no support other than the source code. Debugging support is primitive, oh, and there is no test suite...</p>

<p><strong>If you have not yet been scared off you should be able to to build it by changing into the root of the source tree, then try:</strong></p>

<p><code>./make-sioo</code></p>

<p>You may need to </p>

<p><code>chmod u+x make-sioo</code></p>

<p>This is a simple sh script that manages the process, it will build the kernel, headers and the cli interface and dump it all into the out directory. There is no install yet. Note that at this time the kernel is built with an autotools</p>

<p><code>./configure &amp;&amp; make</code> </p>

<p>process but the CLI is built with a hand-rolled make file.</p>

<p><strong>Suggested Reading</strong> includes <em>Unified Theories of Cognition</em> by Allen Newell (Harvard Press), and <em>The Soar Cognitive Architecture</em> by John Laird (MIT Press). </p>

<p><strong>Production Systems</strong> Wikipedia has a decent article on "<em>Production Systems (Computer Science)</em>" if you need a starting point on what this type of software system is used for and how.</p>

<p><strong>Robot Systems</strong> If you are building a Robot, google "<em>Jess</em>" and also try "<em>Open Cognition</em>". SiOO is really a research project, not a ready to use AGI system. But it does work ;-)</p>

<p><strong>Using the CLI Demos</strong></p>

<p>Note that you need to change to the build directory of the CLI system, and then run <code>sioo</code> from that directory or the system won't find the demos. The demos do work, and this hassle is a listed bug. <strong>NOTE</strong> the demos are named <code>counter-demo</code> and <code>toh-demo</code> </p>
