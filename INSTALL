REQUIREMENTS:

* GNU Tool Chain including autotools, gcc, /bin/sh and the *nix userland.
* We are using bash but your posix shell should work fine.

There is no porting or portability to MS Windows or Mac OSX. Sorry.

DEFAULT BUILD:

To build the entire system with default settings in a terminal:

cd to the root of the source tree

./make-SiOO

For now, the make-SiOO(sh) shell script erases all intermediary files and all 
output files before beginning the build process. This is simply for testing 
sanity to ensure consistency between builds. Source trees that are controlled 
by autotools scripts are "make distclean". Files moved or created by 
make-SiOO(sh) are erased by the same.

The build will progress rapidly and verbosely. The finished files are in the 
"out" directory and can be run from there or moved wherever you wish to 
install them. We will have an automagical install target by 9.9.2.


Debugger: compile with -g and use gdb. 

There is no visual IDE, visual Debugger, or GUI of any sort. Sorry.
