This file contains the installation and (optional) build instructions for 
Soar 8.5.2 for the following platforms:

1.   Installing and running Soar on Windows 9x/Me/NT/2000/XP
2.   OPTIONAL: Building Soar on Windows 9x/Me/NT/2000/XP
3.   Installing, running, and building Soar on GNU/Linux and Unix

__________________________________________________________
1. Installing and running Soar on Windows 9x/Me/NT/2000/XP
----------------------------------------------------------

Requirements for running Soar 8.5.2 on Windows:  
1.1  The Soar Suite 8.5.2 distribution installer from:
     http://sitemaker.umich.edu/soar/soar_software_downloads

1.2  To run VisualSoar (an optional component), you will need to download and
     install version 1.3 or newer of the Java runtime environment:
     http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html

Installation:
1.3  Double click the Setup-Soar-Suite-8.5.2.exe installer and follow the 
     prompts. By default, it will install Soar and its components and 
     documentation into your Program Files folder.  If you are an advanced
     user, you may choose to select what components you would like included 
     in the install.

Running Soar:
1.4  Start Soar by launching the Start Soar icon listed in your start menu
     under the folder "Soar".  After a few moments, the Agent Control Panel
     will pop up, and shortly after that, an agent window will pop up with the
     name "soar1".  The agent window has pulldown menus for issuing many Soar 
     commands, for viewing help, and to load and run Soar demos.
     
1.5  You can start the other components distributed with Soar by launching 
     their icons in the "Soar" start menu folder.

2. OPTIONAL: Building Soar on Windows 9x/Me/NT/2000/XP
------------------------------------------------------
   
If you were not able to get through these steps, please send email to 
soar-group@lists.sourceforge.net describing the results of each step above. 
We'll try to respond within a few hours.

Requirements for building Soar 8.5.2 Windows (optional):
2.1  Microsoft Visual C++, version 6.0.  Although we do not use versions 
     greater than 6.0 for developing Soar, newer versions may work without 
     too much trouble.  Other compilers may also work but have not been tested.

Building Soar (optional):
2.2  Go to the kernel subfolder (inside the soar-8.5.2 folder) and open the 
     Kernel.dsw project file.
     
2.3  Build soarkernel.lib.

2.4  Open the SoarInterface.dsw project file in the Interface folder.

2.5  Build libsoar8.5.2.dll.  This must be built *after* the kernel since there
     is static linking going on.  If you rebuild the kernel, you must rebuild
     the interface.
     
2.6  Confirm that the new libsoar8.5.2.dll file exists in the soar-8.5.2/library 
     folder.  It should be automatically moved here after compilation.

3. Installing, running, and building Soar on GNU/Linux and Unix
---------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements for running Soar 8.5.2 on GNU/Linux:
3.1  The X window system.  Installation instructions for X are beyond the scope
     of this document.

3.2  Tcl/Tk version 8.4.6 and BWidgets 1.7 (a Tcl extension).  Newer versions 
     should work.  We recommend downloading and installing ActiveTcl 
     (instructions follow) if you don't know what version you have.
     Installing ActiveTcl will not harm any version of Tcl currently installed
     on your system (it is installed in its own /usr/local/ActiveTcl directory).

     Installing ActiveTcl:
     3.2.1  Get ActiveTcl 8.4.6 or better from here:
     http://www.activestate.com/Products/Download/Download.plex?id=ActiveTcl
     
     3.2.2  Extract the package in your home directory with this command:
     tar xfvz ActiveTcl8.4.6.1-linux-<BUILD>.tar.gz
     
     3.2.3  AS ROOT: run install.sh in the directory you just extracted:
     su root
     cd ActiveTcl8.4.6.1-linux-ix86
     ./install.sh
     
     3.2.4  Accept all defaults during the install process (installing ActiveTcl
     into its own directory in /usr/local).  You do not have to mess with the
     path and manpath environment variables (but go ahead and do that if you know 
     exactly what you are doing).
     
     3.2.5  You no longer need to be (and shouldn't be) root to continue.
     
     3.2.6  You will need to change the first line of init-soar.tcl in step 3.5
     below to point to the ActiveTcl wish binary.
     
3.3  The Soar-Suite 8.5.2 distribution installer from:
     http://sitemaker.umich.edu/soar/soar_software_downloads
     
Installation:
3.4  Extract the soar-suite-8.5.2-linux.tar.gz file.  It will extract into a 
     directory named "soar".  The command when using GNU's tar utility is:
     tar xvfz soar-suite-8.5.2-linux.tar.gz

     2.5.1  If the above command fails, you may need to unzip the files in a separate
     step, like this:
     gunzip soar-suite-8.5.2-linux.tar.gz; tar xvf soar-suite-8.5.2-linux.tar
     
Running Soar:
3.5  Change into the soar-8.5.2 subdir of the newly extracted directory and type this 
     command to run Soar:
     ./init-soar.tcl  

     You may need to change the first line of the init-soar.tcl file to point
     to the location of the wish binary on your machine.  For example, if you
     installed ActiveTcl (above), you probably have to change that line to:
     #!/usr/local/ActiveTcl/bin/wish
     
     If you have other errors, you may need to rebuild the Soar binaries
     (instructions follow).

Requirements for building Soar 8.5.2 GNU/Linux (optional):
3.6  A recent version of GCC and its utilites such as make.  We're not sure 
     what versions other than 3.2.3 and 3.3.3 will work.  2.95.2 should work 
     with no problems.

Building Soar (optional):
3.7  In the Soar directory, execute these commands to build Soar:
     ./make-clean  (ignore error messages if any)
     ./make-soar
