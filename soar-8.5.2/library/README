This directory contains the files that must be present in the Soar
Library directory. When this folder is located in the Soar source tree,
it is called "library."  When the Soar Library directory is located in
the system outside of the Soar source distribution, it is usually called
"soar", and is installed in the same directory as the Tcl and Tk
library directories; e.g.,

"C:\Program Files\Tcl\lib" on the PC,
"Hard Drive:System Folder:Extensions:Tool Command Language" on the Mac,
"/usr/lib" or "/usr/local/lib" or "/usr/tcl/lib" on a Unix platform.

The file "pkgIndex.tcl" is used by the Tcl "package require" command
to identify and load Soar.

The file "pushd.tcl" is borrowed from a Tcl X extension, and
implements the "pushd" and "popd" commands.

The file "soar.tcl" is automatically sourced when a new Soar
interpreter is created. It sets up some useful commands and
environment variables. You can alter it to suit your needs as
necessary.

The file "soar7.2km-aliases.tcl" is automatically source'd from
within the soar.tcl file.  This file defines aliases based on
the keyboard model and is provided by Frank Ritter.  Read the
file itself for more information.

Any file called libsoar*  is the compiled soar library for running
Soar.  It is very likely a shared, or dynamically-loaded, library
that gets loaded into Wish.


The following information pertains to Soar 7 only.  It is obsolete
for Soar8:

The file "default.soar" contains Soar's default productions. The
"soar.tcl" file automatically defines a vairable "$default" that
contains the full path name of this file, so to load Soar's default
productions, simply type "source $default" after loading Soar into an
interpreter with "package require Soar".

The file "alias-soar6.tcl" contains a set of aliases that make Soar7
work a little bit more like Soar6.
