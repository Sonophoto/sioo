# # ABSTRACT. These Soar productions implement the waterjug task. 
# The task is to find the sequence of steps that fill the three-gallon  
# jug with one gallon of water.  There is a well that has an infinite 
# amount of water, a five-gallon jug, and a three-gallon jug. 
# # Two versions:  
# # water-jug.soar 
#    Simple impasse-free problem solving without planning. 
# # water-jug-look-ahead.soar 
#    Same formulation as in waterjug.soar, but has additional 
#     rules to support lookahead planning. Automatically loads 
#     in required default rules. Chunking also works with this. 
# # These systems are covered in the Soar 8 Tutorial Part I and V.
