# This is a simple version of blocks world
# Three blocks and the table.
# Random search within the top space - all operators indifferent.

# Only search control is to avoid moving the same block twice in a row.

# In this formulation, clear is computed as an elaboration
# (in elaborations/clear). The table is always clear.
