# blocks-world.soar
#    Straight forward implementation of blocks-world
#    Uses look-ahead search to stack three blocks.
#    Look-ahead search is implemented in ../default/selection.soar
#
# blocks-opsub.soar
#    Demonstrates means-ends analysis and operator-subgoaling.
#    Will select operators that cannot apply and must then
#     generate subgoals in which other operators are applied
#     to modify the state so the preconditions of the originally
#     selected operator are achieved.  Does not chunk correctly -
#     a continual problem with operator subgoaling.
#    Does not use ../default/opsub.soar but uses a simplier 
#     version included in the file.
