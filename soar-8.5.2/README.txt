Soar is a general cognitive architecture for developing systems that exhibit 
intelligent behavior. Researchers all over the world, both from the fields of 
artificial intelligence and cognitive science, are using Soar for a variety of 
tasks. It has been in use since 1983, evolving through many different versions 
to where it is now Soar, Version 8.5.2.
