This directory contains all the Help documention on Soar.

To add the Soar man pages to your MANPATH, add the following command
to the end of your .cshrc file:

  setenv MANPATH ${MANPATH}:<this-directory>/man

where <this-directory> is the full directory pathname that this
README file resides in.

The man pages are the source for all documentation.  New pages should
be added to the man directory only.  The cat pages are formed by 
passing each man page through "nroff -man".  The html pages are formed
by passing each man page through "man2html", a program obtained from
the main Tcl Archive as tk2html.  Postscript pages can be formed by 
passing the man pages through "psroff".  The only exception to this 
translation procedure is that the file html/soar_man.html must be 
updated manually for now since it is an HTML file listing the
available commands.

The program update-man-page takes two arguments -- a conversion format
(-cat or -html) and a man page name (e.g., "sp").  It runs the above 
translators to update the cat and html directories.  The Perl script 
"make_doc_from_C_file.pl" runs over a C file with Tcl formatted
comments and produces a set of files that contain header documentation
for functions.  The script was run over an early version of the 
"soarCommands.c" file to generate a set of files from which the man 
pages were derived.
