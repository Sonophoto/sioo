NAME
     max_elaborations - Set  or  list  the  maximum  elaborations
     allowed

SYNOPSIS
     set max_elaborations [_c_o_u_n_t]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     max_elaborations is a Soar variable which, through  the  Tcl
     _s_e_t  command, sets and prints the maximum number of elabora-
     tion  cycles  allowed.   If  _c_o_u_n_t  is   not   given,   'set
     max_elaborations'  prints  the current number of elaboration
     cycles allowed.  If _c_o_u_n_t is given, it must  be  a  positive
     integer  and is used to reset the number of allowed elabora-
     tion cycles.

     The "max_elaborations" parameter controls the maximum number
     of  elaborations  allowed in a single decision cycle.  After
     this limit has  been  reached  in  a  decision  cycle,  Soar
     proceeds  to decision phase even if quiescence hasn't really
     been reached  yet.   The  default  initial  setting  of  the
     "max_elaborations" parameter is 100.
