NAME
     io - Manage attachment of scripts to Soar I/O

SYNOPSIS
     io _a_c_t_i_o_n
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     This command manages the attachment of scripts to Soar  I/O.
     Soar  has an event defined for input and another for output.
     Scripts can be attached to these Soar events  so  that  they
     are  invoked every time the Soar event occurs. These scripts
     can later be removed using the io  command.  The  status  of
     attachments  can  be  listed  also.   If a new attachment is
     created, its identifier is returned as the  result  of  this
     command.

     The specified _a_c_t_i_o_n must have one of the following forms:

     -add [-input | -output] _s_c_r_i_p_t [_i_d]
          Add the _s_c_r_i_p_t to the list of  scripts  to  be  invoked
          when the -input or output event occurs in the Soar ker-
          nel. If the _i_d is given, it is used to name the attach-
          ment.  If no _i_d is given, then a unique id is generated
          and returned.  The id is necessary if a user ever wants
          to delete an action.

     -delete [-input | -output] _i_d
          Remove script attachment named _i_d.

     -list [-input | -output]
          List all attachments of scripts to Soar input  or  out-
          put.

     A detailed example of using Soar I/O in Tcl is given in  the
     file demos/soar-io-using-tcl.tcl.
