NAME
     Soar variables


DESCRIPTION
     There are a number of  Soar  variables  that  influence  the
     behavior  of Soar. These variables are given default values,
     which can be changed using the  Tcl  _s_e_t  command.  However,
     unlike  normal  Tcl  variables,  Soar  variables  do have an
     enforced type and can not be unset.

     The defined Soar variables are:

          attribute_preferences_mode [0|1|2]
               The "attribute_preferences_mode" variable is  used
               to control the handling of preferences (other than
               acceptable and reject preferences).

          default_wme_depth [0|1|2]
               The "default_wme_depth" variable is used  to  con-
               trol  the default printing depth of the print com-
               mand.

          max_chunks [positive integer]
               The "max_chunks"  variable  controls  the  maximum
               number  of  chunks that can be created in a single
               decision cycle.

          max_elaborations [positive integer]
               The "max_elaborations" variable controls the  max-
               imum  number  of  elaborations allowed in a single
               decision cycle.

          max_nil_output_cycles [positive integer]
               The "max_nil_output_cycles" variable controls  the
               maximum  number  of  consecutive nil output cycles
               allowed when run-til-output-generated (or _r_u_n _o_u_t)
               is used.

          o_support_mode [0|1|2]
               The "o_support_mode" variable is used  to  control
               the  way  o-support  calculations are done for the
               agent.

          real_time_per_decision [positive integer]
               The "real_time_per_decision" variable controls the
               minumum amount of time that Soar will take to com-
               plete a decision cycle (in milliseconds).  A deci-
               sion  cycle may take longer if Soar is still work-
               ing.  The compiler option REAL_TIME_BEHAVIOR  must

               be enabled for this variable.

          save_backtraces (boolean)
               The "save_backtraces" variable  enables  and  dis-
               ables  the  saving of backtracing information.  It
               must be on for the _e_x_p_l_a_i_n-_b_a_c_k_t_r_a_c_e_s  command  to
               provide backtracing information.

          warnings (boolean)
               This "warnings" variable enables and disables  the
               printing of warning messages.
