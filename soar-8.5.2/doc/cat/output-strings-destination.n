NAME
     output-strings-destination - Specify  destination  of  print
     actions

SYNOPSIS
     output-strings-destination _a_c_t_i_o_n
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     This command redirects the printing of output strings.  This
     is  useful  for  applications  which  need  to  change where
     printed results are placed.  Printed output is normally sent
     to  standard output.  However, if a Graphical User Interface
     (GUI) is being used in place  of  the  command  line  inter-
     preter,  then printed output should appear in the GUI.  GUIs
     are composed of elements called "widget"s and printed output
     would be directed to a "text widget", or procedure.

     Printed output is normally sent to standard output which  is
     an open file descriptor in UNIX.  Printed output can be sent
     to any other open file descriptor as well, such as  an  open
     file  or  pipe.  It  is  also  possible that the user is not
     interested in an agent's printed output.  In that case,  the
     printed  output  can be discarded -- which results in faster
     processing for the agent as well.

     Some Soar commands return results and  some  print  results.
     If  the user wishes to have printed results returned so that
     they can be saved for later use, then this command can setup
     the agent to append the printed output to the normal result.
     This capability is also useful when  sending  Soar  commands
     from  remote  Tcl/Tk interpreters.  By appending the printed
     results, all printed  characters  can  be  returned  to  the
     remote interpreter rather than going to a screen.

     The printing facility is implemented as a  stack,  so  newly
     installed  print  redirections are in force until popped off
     the stack.  This is done to allow easy transient redirection
     and  the  restoration  of prior printing contexts after com-
     pleting a printing  task.   Hence,  there  are  two  primary
     _a_c_t_i_o_ns,  -push  and  -pop.   The -pop action takes no addi-
     tional arguments  as  it  serves  only  to  pop  the  print-
     redirection  stack  to  re-establish the prior printing con-
     text.  The -push action takes the following additional argu-
     ments:

     -append-to-result
          Instead of printing, append the output  string  to  the
          result  returned  by  a command.  This option is useful

          for getting all the output when the command is  invoked
          remotely.

     -channel _o_p_e_n-_f_i_l_e-_i_d
          Redirect prints to the  open  channel  (file  or  pipe)
          denoted by _o_p_e_n-_f_i_l_e-_i_d

     -discard
          Ignore prints (similar to redirecting to  /dev/null  in
          the Bourne shell, sh)

     -procedure _p_r_o_c-_n_a_m_e
          Redirect prints to the Tcl procedure named _p_r_o_c-_n_a_m_e in
          the  current  interpreter.   Tk  widgets  are also pro-
          cedures, so this action sends  output  to  widget  pro-
          cedures (or any other Tcl procedure).

     -text-widget _w_i_d_g_e_t-_n_a_m_e [_i_n_t_e_r_p-_n_a_m_e]
          Redirect prints to the text widget named _w_i_d_g_e_t-_n_a_m_e in
          the  current interpreter.  If _i_n_t_e_r_p-_n_a_m_e is specified,
          then prints are redirected to  the  text  widget  named
          _w_i_d_g_e_t-_n_a_m_e in the interpreter named _i_n_t_e_r_p-_n_a_m_e.


EXAMPLES
     This example redirects prints to the text widget ".text":

          output-strings-destination -push -text-widget .text
9
     This example redirects prints to the text widget  ".textual"
     in the interpreter named control:

          output-strings-destination -push -text-widget .textual control
9
     This example redirects prints to the open file "stdout":

          output-strings-destination -push -file-id stdout
9
     This example causes all printing to be supressed:

          output-strings-destination -push -discard
9
     This example removes the most recently added print  destina-
     tion:

          output-strings-destination -pop
9

WARNINGS
     This command only affects the  printing  generated  by  Soar
     commands  such as print and echo.  It does not affect print-
     ing done by the Tcl commands such as puts.
