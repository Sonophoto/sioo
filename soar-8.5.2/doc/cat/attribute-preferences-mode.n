_________________________________________________________________

NAME
     attribute-preferences-mode  -  Set  or  list  the  attribute
     preferences mode

SYNOPSIS
     attribute-preferences-mode [_m_o_d_e]
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
     This command is obsolete for Soar 8.  In Soar  8,  the  code
     automatically operates as if attribute-preferences-mode = 2.

     For Soar 7, this command  sets  and  prints  the  attributes
     preferences mode.  If _m_o_d_e is not given, this command prints
     the current attribute preferences mode.  If _m_o_d_e  is  given,
     it  must  be  one of the positive integers 0, 1, or 2 and is
     used to reset the attribute preferences modes.

     The "attribute-preferences-mode" parameter is used  to  con-
     trol  the handling of preferences (other than acceptable and
     reject preferences) for non-context slots.   The  _m_o_d_e  set-
     tings have the following interpretations:

     0    Handle them the normal (Soar 6) way.

     1    Handle them the normal (Soar 6) way, but print a  warn-
          ing  message whenever a preference other than + or - is
          created for a non-context slot.

     2    Whenever a preferences other than + or - is created for
          a  non-context  slot, print an error message and ignore
          (discard) that preference.  For non-context slots,  the
          set  of  values  installed  in working memory is always
          equal to the set of acceptable values minus the set  of
          rejected values.

     The default initial setting of  the  "attribute-preferences-
     mode" parameter is 0.


EXAMPLES
     The command issued with no arguments,  returns  the  current
     mode:

          attribute-preferences-mode

     The next example makes use of Tcl command abbreviation while
     setting the mode to 1:

VARIABLE
     Note that the commandname uses dashes to separate the words.
     There  is  also a Soar variable "attribute_preferences_mode"
     (with underscores) that can be used to set the mode  through
     the  the Tcl _s_e_t command. If the  _m_o_d_e is not given, the Tcl
     _s_e_t command prints the current attribute  preferences  mode.
     If _m_o_d_e is given, it must be one of the positive integers 0,
     1, or 2 and is  used  to  reset  the  attribute  preferences
     modes.

     set attribute_preferences_mode       returns the current mode

     set attribute_preferences_mode 1     sets the mode to 1

     Soar variables cannot be abbreviated in the same  manner  as
     commandnames.
