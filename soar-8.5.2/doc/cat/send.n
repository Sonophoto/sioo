NAME
     send - Send interpreter a script to execute

SYNOPSIS
     send _n_a_m_e _s_c_r_i_p_t

DESCRIPTION
     This command sends the interpreter _n_a_m_e a Tcl _s_c_r_i_p_t  to  be
     executed.   The  result  of  executing  the  command  in the
     receiving interpreter is returned as the result of the  send
     command.  This command generalizes the standard Tk send com-
     mand so that it applies to local  non-wish  interpreters  as
     well  as  wish-based  ones.   Remote sends are only possible
     with wish-based interpreters since a  connection  to  the  X
     server is needed.
