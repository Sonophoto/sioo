NAME
     Soar TSI: TclSoar Interface


DESCRIPTION
     The TSI provides a graphical user interface for  interacting
     with  Soar.   It  is based on ideas from Frank Ritter's DSI,
     and the SCA2 work done by Doug Pearson.   The  Soar  Command
     Line  Interface  window  is  essentially the one produced by
     Randy Jones as a development of Karl Schwamb's original  GUI
     for Soar.

     The TSI consists of a set of optional windows that include:

     1.   A control panel to provide easy  access  to  the  basic
          functions  that  are  necessary or useful to run a Soar
          model.  It also supports running multiple  Soar  agents
          at the same time.

     2.   An interaction window for  Soar,  providing  equivalent
          functionality  to  the  old command line interface, but
          with a set of menus and buttons available.

     3.   A display of the match set of rules about to fire.

     4.   A continuous display of the current state of  the  goal
          stack.

     5.   A print window that supports the examination of objects
          selected  by  the user.  (The user either presses p, or
          double clicks with the  middle  mouse  button  once  an
          object has been selected.)


     The TSI is normally found  in  the  $soar_library  directory
     (folder),  but  can  be  moved anywhere, provided the global
     variable, tsi_library, is properly  and  accurately  defined
     when  running Wish.  However, if the TSI is moved, it's pos-
     sible (likely) that it will not be able  to  find  the  Soar
     help  files  or  Soar demo files.  Users should become quite
     familiar with the TSI code  before  trying  to  move  it  to
     another location.  In $tsi_library is the main "tcl library"
     of code that implements the TSI.  All tsi commands  will  be
     autoloaded  from this directory or folder (assuming your tcl
     interpreter knows where this directory or folder  is).   See
     the  file "start-soar.tcl" in the top-level directory of the
     Soar distribution for more information on what needs  to  be
     defined when starting Soar.

LOADING THE TSI
     Since Soar version 7.2, the TSI has been packaged  with  the
     Soar  distribution.   It  will be invoked if Soar is started
     using the "start-soar.tcl" script  found  in  the  top-level
     directory  (folder)  of  the Soar distribution.  The "start-
     soar.tcl" script defines the $tsi_library variable and  adds
     it  to  the auto_path so that the TSI commands are automati-
     cally available in Soar.


MODIFYING THE TSI
     Users can change some settings for the TSI by creating their
     own  tsi-defaults.tcl  file. Users wishing to further modify
     the TSI, are encouraged to create a new folder or  subdirec-
     tory  in  the  $soar_library  folder, and copy the TSI files
     into the new folder,  and  then  redefine  the  $tsi_library
     variable.  That way there will always be a distribution copy
     of the TSI, and there will be less confusion if the modified
     TSI  is  sent to other Soar users or TSI developers.  If the
     working copy of the TSI is moved out  of  the  $soar_library
     location,  the  TSI  may  not  be able to find the Soar help
     pages or the Soar demos, unless it is specifically  modified
     to look in the proper locations.


FILES
     Unless otherwise noted, all files listed below are found  in
     the library/tsi* directory (folder).


     README
          Description of the TSI, similar to this man page

     tsi-defaults.tcl
          This specifies some default values for  the  configura-
          tion  of  the  TSI.   To override the defaults, you can
          make a file named tsi-defaults.tcl in the directory  or
          folder  from which you run Soar, and specify the values
          you want to override.

     tsiInit.tcl
          Provides the hooks to start up the TSI  and  to  create
          new agent (and other) interpreters.

     tsiControlPanel.tcl
          Creates a simple control panel to drive  Soar.   Allows
          the creation of mutiple Soar agents.

TclSoar-Interface(n)      Soar Commands      TclSoar-Interface(n)



     tsiDialogs.tcl
          A set of "standard" dialogs for user interaction.

     tsiPopUp.tcl
          Implements PopUp menus for interacting with Soar.

     termText.tcl
          A simple terminal widget  for  tcl/tk  (which  the  TSI
          agent windows use).

     tsiAgentText.tcl
          Enhancements to termText for Soar agents

     tsiAgentWindow.tcl
          Implements a window for interacting with  Soar  agents.
          Uses tsiAgentText for the main window, and adds a bunch
          of menus, buttons, and whirligigs.

     tsiUtils.tcl
          A collection of  utilities  supporting  the  interface,
          including  agent windows as well as other types of win-
          dows (such as monitor windows).

     tclIndex
          This file is used by Tcl to autoload various  TSI  com-
          mands  and  procedures.  Do not mess with it or move it
          (unless you are making enhancements to the TSI code and
          know what you are doing).

     tsi/demos subdirectory or subfolder:
          This directory or folder contains a few  Soar  programs
          that  make  use  (to  varying  degrees)  of some of the
          features in the TSI.  The TSI code  assumes  that  this
          demos  directory (folder) is a subdirectory (subfolder)
          of the directory (folder) holding the  main  TSI  code.
          If you move this directory or folder somewhere else, or
          rename it, the menus for selecting these demo  programs
          will probably fail to function.

                    analogy.s7
