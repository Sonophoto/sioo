\fBcapture-input\fR \fIaction\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command may be used to start and stop the recording of
input function commands as created by an external simulation.

recorded decision cycle by decision cycle.  Use the command
replay-input to replay the sequence.  The \fIaction\fR must 
be one of the following:
.TP
\fB-open\fR \fIpathname\fR
A log file named \fIpathname\fR is created and input capturing is initiated.
.TP
\fB-query\fR
Returns \fBopen\fR if capturing is active, or \fBclosed\fR if
capturing is not active.
.TP
\fB-off\fR
Close the captured input file.

.SH EXAMPLES

.DS
\fBcapture-input -new foo.in\fR
.DE
.PP
This terminates capturing and closes the open log file:
.DS
\fBcapture-input -off\fR
