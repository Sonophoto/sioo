This directory contains various demo programs for Soar 7.  More detail
about the directories are:

 C_extension        - An example of adding user C code to Soar 7.
 FSBox              - Tcl code for defining and using a file selection dialog
 gui                - Soar code examples with a Tk GUI interface
 no-gui             - Soar code examples that are runnable via stdio

The subdirectories contain README files that give more detail about
their demos.  

The Soar group welcomes additions to this demo directory.
Some possible ideas for other demos include the following:

  - Agents playing tic_tac_toe with other agents or users
  - A Status window with agent information: #agents, stats, control buttons
  - Drag and drop: e.g. drag file icons into Soar window --> initiates a load
  - Use TclDP to communicate with remote Soars 
  - 1 GUI display controlling remote Soar agents
  - Add an icon bar to gui.tcl
  - Add a MIME type of text/x-soar to .mailcap to show program sharing
    via email.  Could use for co-operative work, bug reports, etc.
  - Show multi-agent timing info, e.g., msec/dc for all agents.
  - Show use with SDE, e.g. operator name brings up WWW document on operator
  - A dialog that enables users to select which commands to add to the
    Quick Action keys at the bottom of the top-level GUI
