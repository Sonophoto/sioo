This directory contains the code for the eight_puzzle demo.
This demo adds a GUI to the eight puzzle example distributed
with non-Tcl Soar.  This demo illustrates:

  - use of the Soar RHS function "tcl" to update a GUI
  - connecting a simple but non-trivial GUI to a Soar appliation
  - using Tcl procedures to break up script processing

To run this demo, invoke "soartk", move to this directory and 
"source eight_puzzle.tcl"
