## SIOO is an acronym for State Input Operator Output

SiOO is an embeddable cognitive architecture based on Soar 8.5.2. It is being enhanced with a *nix style command shell, an embeddable footprint, and development tools and modifications to the actual cognitive architecture.

If you are looking for an AI system based on "production rule systems" (Rules not Neural Nets) for a serious project or research, please check out "Soar" at https://soar.eecs.umich.edu/ It is an advanced cognitive architecture and is actively maintained at the University of Michigan (12-Dec-2020) Lat time I used it you could use the Eclipse IDE and the Herbal plugin to do devel in a more modern environment. Highly reccomended!
