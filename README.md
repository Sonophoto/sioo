#Soar Suite 8.5.2

***

###This branch is the entire original distribution that I received. 

###It purports to be SoarSuite 8.5.2 and everything I got is right here. 

###It claims in the original files to be under a two clause BSD License

###NO SUPPORT is offered or implied or suggested, it is all on you.

##Rationale

The next thing that happens is we create a new branch named SiOO and
essentially all of these files but the core kernel are deleted. All
additions and modifications from that point are under GPL, this will
rapidly become homogenized...

This branch gives you the opportunity to fork this repository from a 
BSD licensed source tree and do whatever you like with it without 
worrying about GPL.
