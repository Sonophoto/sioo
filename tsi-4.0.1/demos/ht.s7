### Last substantially modified: 3-Nov-96 -FER
### With useful bug fixes from Kate Cook.
###
### 3-Nov-96 Frank Ritter - moved to soar 7.0.4
### 27/7/95  Gary Jones - Altered references to <g> to be <s>.
###                       For example, state <g> is now state <s>.
###                       Just to make it easier to understand.
###                       Also put in learn -off (because it should be).

### 5/7/95   Gary Jones - NNPSCM conversion.

### Saved as Text Only so that it can be loaded into Soar.
### 
### A simple hungry-thirsty problem space and operators
### 
### The code supplied has these characteristics:
###   - The operators Eat & Drink are proposed iff they're 
###     applicable. that is, Eat if (^hungry yes), Drink if (^thirsty yes)
###   - There is an explicit ^desired on the goal
###   - which is tested by the goal attainment rule
###   - There are hand-written control chunks giving Eat best
### 
### Example command within Soar to get to this code and load it:
### 
### Macintosh: cd "joe:EuroSoar7:tutorial"
### Unix:      cd "/aigr/staff/ritter/res/soar/euro-soar93/tutorial/"
### 
### Then:   source "ht.s7"

### 	i.	Some simple things to help beginners
###

## For safety, excise -all
excise -all

## Resets the watch level to the base level in case you changed it:
watch 1
puts "watch 1"

learn -off
puts "learn -off "

## Default is not to print chunks as learned!
watch learning -print
## This makes chunk firings print
watch -chunks -print

## What to do with sets of indifferent context elements: take the
## first one.
indifferent-selection -first

## Upon reload, resetting the goal stack to be empty is usually
## required and is a good idea:

init-soar
puts "init-soar"


### 
###	I.	Propose the top space
###
### The code in this section proposes a simple space to work in, and a

### simple state to start working in.

sp {ht*propose-space*ht
  (state <s> -^impasse ^superstate nil)
  -->
  (<s> ^name ht-state)
  (<s> ^problem-space <p> ^desired <d>)
  (<p> ^name hungry-thirsty)
  (<d> ^hungry no)
  (<s> ^thirsty yes ^hungry yes)
}

## Propose the top state
## simple way to set up the top-state with a separate production
##sp {ht*propose-state*ht
##  (state <s> ^problem-space.name hungry-thirsty)
##  -->
##  (<s> ^name ht-state)
##  (<s> ^thirsty yes ^hungry yes)}

## You can put the closing parenthesis on its own line (e.g., in the 
## first production) to show that it is closed, but I generally don't
## to save space. 


###
###	II.	Propose the main operators
###
### The code in this section proposes the two operators eat and drink.

### The third production creates a preference for choosing between
### them.


## Propose eat.
sp {ht*propose-op*eat
  (state <s> ^problem-space.name hungry-thirsty )
  (<s> ^hungry yes)
  -->
  (<s> ^operator <o>)
  (<o> ^name eat)}

## Propose drink.
sp {ht*propose-op*drink
  (state <s> ^problem-space.name hungry-thirsty )
  (<s> ^thirsty yes)
  -->
  (<s> ^operator <o>)
  (<o> ^name drink)}

## Eat is better if you are hungry.
sp {ht*compare*eat*better*drink
  (state <s> ^desired <d> ^problem-space.name hungry-thirsty)
  (<d> ^hungry no)
  (<s> ^operator <op-eat> +)
  (<op-eat> ^name eat)
  (<s> ^operator <op-drink> +)
  (<op-drink> ^name drink)
  -->
  (<s> ^operator <op-eat> > <op-drink>)}


###
###	III.	Implement the main operators
###

## Implement the operators with productions that modify the state once
## the operators have been selected, and then terminate them after
## they have done

## what they need to do
##
## Note: We make the new value acceptable and reject the previous
## value.

##
## The reconsider preference effectively terminates the operator on 
## the next decision cycle after it has done what its supposed to do.

sp {ht*apply-op*eat
  (state <s>  ^operator <o>)
  (<o> ^name eat)
  (<s> ^hungry yes)
  -->
  (write (crlf) |          chomp chomp... |)
  (<s> ^hungry yes - no +)}

sp {ht*terminate*eat
  (state <s> ^operator <o>)
  (<o> ^name eat)
  (<s> ^hungry no)
  -->
  (<s> ^operator <o> @)}


## Implement drink
## Note: just making the new value acceptable and best, to
## overwrite any value (or no value) on the state, is not a wise 
## idea (if the another operator applies and makes another attribute
## best you will get ties and lose.  

sp {ht*apply-op*drink
  (state <s>   ^operator <o>)
  (<o> ^name drink)
  (<s> ^thirsty yes)
  -->
  (write (crlf) |          glug glug... |)
  (<s> ^thirsty no + yes -)}

sp {ht*terminate*drink
  (state <s>  ^operator <o>)
  (<o> ^name drink)
  (<s> ^thirsty no)
  -->
  (<s> ^operator <o> @)}



###
###	IV.	Noticing when full
###
### This code terminates the problem solving when the goal is reached.


## How to tell if you can stop
sp {ht*evaluate*state*success
  (state <s> ^desired <d> )
  (<d> ^hungry <val>)
  (<s> ^hungry <val>)
  -->
  (<s> ^success <d>)}


## One of the default rules is brought in to notice that we are 
## finished.  (Slightly modified to be more compact and less general.)

sp {default*top-goal*halt*state*success
    :default
  (state <s>  ^desired <eb>) 
  (<s> ^success <eb>)
  -->
  (write (crlf)  |  goal for  | <s>  | achieved | )
  (halt)}


###
###	V.	Better object traces
###

## Soar6 supports the idea of setting up context element traces.  We 
## include here some better object traces to make the stack trace 
## clearer.
## format-watch -stack -add * {%id (name: %v[name])}
## format-watch -object -add * {%id (name: %v[name])}

## This traces the values of hungry and thirsty on states.
## Be careful not to get a CR in the middle of the string.
## format-watch -stack -add s ht-state {%id (name: %v[name] hungry: %v[hungry] thirsty: %v[thirsty])}

## need to do this to get a new line in soar7.0.0 beta
puts ""
