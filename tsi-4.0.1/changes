5. Chunks

Fixes:

Windows/Mac Conventions
   Control-C Control-V is cut and paste
   Escape is stop instead of ctrl-c
   Click to focus re-enabled
tsi 0 1 re-enabled (0 hides control window (still exists) and creates a single agent, otherwise normal operation)
Added tsiConfig(hasEnvironment) which should be used with Eaters, TankSoar, etc.
Added tsiConfig(interfaceType) determines interface
tsiConfig(expertise) 0 suppress certain menu items.
## -- Saving and loading production memory
## -- Print operator stack
## -- Listing the agents to console
## -- Printing out all command, variable and proc names defined to console
## -- Printing out attribute preference mode to console
## -- Printing out O-support mode to console
## -- Saving backtraces
## -- Eight-puzzle, critter world and GUI demos
## -- Add-wme and Select-operator items
## -- Tcl and Tk help menus
The following suppression mechanism have also been added:tsiConfig(suppressSourceMenu) tsiConfig(suppressAddWME) tsiConfig(suppressSelectOperator) tsiConfig(suppressHelpMenu)
Environments uses stop, standard soar uses stop-soar (due to the fact that environments issues step commands outside of Soar.)  Binding switched depting on tsiConfig(hasEnvironment)
Added buttons for phases -self
Cannot assume .tsw.t.  Now $tsiConfig(tswFrame).t.  Set to .tsw.t when non-graphical interface is used.
Removed redundant menus from View window
Added doc_dir due to different file structures
Fixed a couple more ../ directory problems
Generalized man doc directory stuff.  Now in tsiConfig.  Set once when tsi is initially launched rather than for each interpreter.  Much cleaner.

Changes from tsi 2.4 to tsi 2.5 are as follows:
===============================================

new version number.
default fonts for Tcl 8.0 added.
added history and command completion functions.
fixed "Run" and "Step" buttons on control panel, so they work now.
agent interaction window changes:
        - supports new demos for Soar8.  demo menu is mode-dependent.
	- title bar has agent name first instead of last
	- by default increments x coord for each agent.  can be
	  changed by setting variables in tsi-defaults.tcl
	- changed "Monitor" pulldownMenu to "View"
	- added "Productions" for viewing productions. added new
              tsiConfig(maxUserProdMenu) to limit number of prods
              that the tsi tries to display. the default is 
              set to zero, which doesn't limit the number at all.
	- added "Tower Noticing" tower-of-hanoi demo from Tim Chapman
	  (per bug report 235 request from Frank Ritter)
http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/pub/soar/nottingham/tower-noticing-toh/tn-toh.html

File changes:
=============
termText.tcl -- added history functions and command completion.  History
  stuff initially started by Brad Kean (undergrad at umich) and revised
  by K Coulter.

tsi-defaults.tcl -- added default fonts that work with Tcl 8.0 (but
  didn't add font objects yet...).  Added four config variables:
  AgentWindowDeltaX -- amount to increment window in X for new agent
  AgentWindowDeltaY -- amount to increment window in Y for new agent
  window_count -- total count of agent windows created (may be different
    from number of agents that exist, if agents have been deleted)
  maxUserProdMenu -- max number of user productions to try to support
    in Production pulldownMenu on Agent Window.

tsiAgentWindow.tcl -- changed title so agent name is first
    added call to tsiAddProductionMenu
    added routines for supporting Soar8 demos

tsiControlPanel.tcl -- fixed step/run/stop buttons so they call the
    first agent and issue a proper command.  Added procs
    tsiRun-soar and tsiStep-soar

tsiInit.tcl -- new version number (2.5) and changed args to
    makeSoarInteractionWindow so agent window coordinates are
    set according to parameters in tsi-defaults.tcl  (default is
    to increment X direction by 40 for each new agent)

tsiUtils.tcl -- renamed "Monitor" menu to "View"
    added routines for productions menu for displaying productions
    added routines for supporting Soar8 demos
    added Tim Chapin's Tower-of-Hanoi demo  (if file exists...)


Immediate TODO:
===============

1.  rename all procs to start with "tsi"  (really don't want all
    these procnames cluttering the Soar command info...)
2.  integrate support for remote agents (Scott's tsi30)
3.  integrate Tony Hirst's viSteam utilities.
4.  add second cascade level to productions menu to get better filtering
5.  use font objects
6.  change ctl-c for soar to escape or something, so that we can
    use ctl-c for cut&paste hotkeys.

(might be better to do #1 after 2 & 3 to make integration easier)
