==>What is "Drag and Drop"?
It's a common method for manipulating objects under a graphical user
interface. The user moves the mouse pointer over an icon (or other
object) and presses a mouse button. The user holds the button down
while moving the pointer ("dragging" the object) to another place.
The meaning of this action can often be modified by holding certain
keys on the keyboard at the same time.

When using drag and drop with the datamap you should note that the
mouse cursor changes as you begin the operation (the drag part).
