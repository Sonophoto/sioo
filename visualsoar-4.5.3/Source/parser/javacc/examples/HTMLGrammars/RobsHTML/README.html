    <h1>README</h1>

    <p>This directory contains the source for a mostly complete HTML
      3.2 parser.  It is based upon the "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Draft
      19960821//EN" DTD.  Unlike most browsers, this parser is rather
      finicky about the input.  Although correct HTML 3.2 should get
      through it without causing an error, it is by no means a
      validating parser.  For that I suggest you use James Clark's <a
      href="http://www.jclark.com/sp/index.htm">SP</a> SGML parser at
      &lt;http://www.jclark.com/sp/index.htm>.  Certain things are not
      implemented properly: I encourage you to take this parser as a
      starting point and improve it.  Limitations I'm aware of
      are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>no inclusion or exclusion exceptions.  I've tried to fake it
	in a couple of places.  You may run into problems that require
	further hackery though.</li>

      <li>incorrect handling of character data.  Mostly it works OK,
	but you'll see extra record end characters (newlines).</li>

      <li>no entity handling.  This would be a good place for someone
	to start improving the parser.  Use lexical actions to
	substitute the correct characters for things like &amp;amp;
	etc.</li>

      <li>doesn't ignore unknown tags.</li>

      <li>doesn't parse attribute values.  It doesn't check the values
	that are provide for attributes, although it isn't difficult
	to add this to the grammar for certain kinds of
	attribute(hint, hint).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Building and running the HTML parser</h2>

    <p>The parser is written using JJTree to create a simple
      representation of the HTML input.  To build the parser you have
      to:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>run JJTree on the source</li>
      <li>run JavaCC on the grammar file that JJTree generates</li>
      <li>compile the Java code in the usual way</li>
      <li>run the parser on some input</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Here's how a build looks on my system:</p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <p>This parser uses JJTree Simple mode.  It also uses a couple of
      specialized node classes for representing PCDATA and attributes.
      It should all seem pretty obvious once you take a look. </p>
