The best way to learn about the three tools:

. The parser generator "javacc"

. The tree building pre-processor "jjtree"

. The document generator "jjdoc"

is to read the documentation from the web pages.

However, you can read the files in the directory for immediate
information as follows:

doc/README
	This file.
doc/INSTALLATIONNOTES
	Contains installation tips.
doc/javacc.RELEASENOTES
	If you know how to use Version 0.5 of JavaCC, this file will
	quickly get you uptodate with the new features and tips on
	how to use them.
doc/javacc.DETAILEDNOTES
	Complete details of everything that has changed since Version
	0.5.  This is useful for an in-depth understanding of how the
	new version has changed.
doc/jjtree.RELEASENOTES
	Rough initial documentation for the tree building pre-processor
	called JJTree.
doc/jjdoc.RELEASENOTES
	Documentation for JJDoc, the tool that generates documents
	(such as HTML) from JavaCC grammar files.

Another place to learn more about these tools is the "examples"
directory.  By looking at the examples here along with reading all
the "README" files, you should get a good handle on the tools and
should be able to get started.
