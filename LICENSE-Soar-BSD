*                                                                             *
* ONLY the original files in this repository are covered by this license. In  *
* an interesting twist, the function print_startup_banner(), in the file      *
* kernel/init_soar.c in fact claims that the "The Soar consortium proclaims   *
* this software is in the public domain, and is made available AS IS." This   *
* statement was published everytime this software started... YMMV...          *
*                                                                             * 
* In any case, the following applies:                                         *
*                                                                             *
*    --> ALL CHANGES to the original files are covered under the GPL. <--     *
*                                                                             *
* WHAT THIS MEANS: If you want to hide source then start with Soar 8.5.2 and  *
* release YOUR changes under whatever license you like. If you want to use    *
* SiOO then you are legally bound by the GPL when you use ANY of our          *
* modifications to the original Soar 8.5.2                                    *
*                                                                             *
* The original 2 commits to this repo created a README.md and loaded the      * 
* entire SoarSuite 8.5.2 source tree specifically to enable you to fork       * 
* from that repository and create a BSD licensed (or possibly public domain)  *
* Soar 8.5.2 project for your own development.                                *
*                                                                             *
