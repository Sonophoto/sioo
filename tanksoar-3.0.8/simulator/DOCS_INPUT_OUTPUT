Sensor Summary:
-----------------------------------------

Blocked Sensor: The allows the tank to detect whether one of the squares he is immediately adjacent to is blocked.
- Sensor Range: 1 space.
- Domain: yes no (in each direction)

Radar Sensor:  Each tank is equipped with a forward-probing radar.  This allows the tank to "look" straight ahead in a tunnel-vision fashion (width of three spaces).  The tank can see whether a space is open, blocked or contains one of the following items:  another tank, a health pool, or an energy pool.  
- Sensor Range:	As far as its radar setting is set.
- Domain:   see specifications of input link below

RWaves Sensor:  Whenever a tank is using his radar, it is emitting RWaves.  This sensor detects whether there are any RWaves shining on you in any of the four cardinal directions.  Basically, it's whether a tank can see you.
- Sensor Range:  Unlimited.
- Domain: yes no (in each direction)

Sound Sensor:  Tanks are large, heavy machines that effect much noise in their wake.  Using this sensor, another tank can determine the direction to the closest tank.  It will determine an unblocked route to the closest tank and tell you which direction to move in next. Note that a tank that did not move or rotate in its last move will not be detected.
- Sensor Range: 7
- Domain: left, right, forward, backward, silent

Smell Sensor:  Naturally, tanks are very pungent (they are usually driven by smelly graduate students.)  What is interesting though, is that each color of tank emits its own smell.  This sensor uses this to determine how far away the closest tank is and what color it is.  For example, it could tell you that the purple tank is 7 spaces away.
- Range: Unlimited.
- Domain: color and distance value

Incoming Sensor:  This sensor will tell you whether there is an approaching missile in one of the four cardinal directions.  This sensor is smart enought to not detect your own missiles.
- Sensor Range: Unlimited.
- Domain: yes no (in each direction)

Note: the Sound sensor non-deterministically returns a path from the set of valid paths it finds.  For example, there may be more than one shortest path from which the Sound sensor will choose among.

The input-link, i.e. the percepts:
-----------------------------------------
- directions come in 2 flavors:
  - relative: forward, backward, left, right
  - cardinal: north, south, east, west
