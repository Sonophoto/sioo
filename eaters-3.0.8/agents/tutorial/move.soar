# These are the final versions of the rules for the generalized move operator
# 
# Propose*move:
# If there is normalfood, bonusfood, eater, or empty in an adjacent cell, 
#    propose move in the direction of that cell
#    and indicate that this operator can be selected randomly.

# Apply*move
# If the move operator for a direction is selected,
#    generate an output command to move in that direction.

#    then remove that command.

# Select*move*bonusfood-better-than-normalfood
# If there is a proposed operator to move to a cell with bonusfood and 
#    there is a second proposed operator to move to a cell that is empty or
#    has normalfood
#    prefer the first operator.
